The University of Washington (commonly referred to as UW, simply Washington, or informally U-Dub)[6] is a public research university in Seattle, Washington.

Founded in 1861, Washington was first established in downtown Seattle approximately a decade after the city's founding to aid its economic development. Today, the university's 703-acre main Seattle campus is situated in the University District above the Montlake Cut, within the urban Puget Sound region of the Pacific Northwest. The university has two additional campuses in Tacoma and Bothell. Overall, UW encompasses over 500 buildings and over 20 million gross square footage of space, including one of the largest library systems in the world with over 26 university libraries, as well as the UW Tower, lecture halls, art centers, museums, laboratories, stadiums, and conference centers. The university offers bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees through 140 departments in various colleges and schools, sees about 46,000 in total student enrollment every year, and functions on a quarter system.

Washington is a member of the Association of American Universities and classified as an R1 Doctoral Research University classification under the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. It is cited as a leading university in the world for scientific performance and research output by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and the CWTS Leiden Ranking. In the 2015 fiscal year, the UW received nearly $1.2 billion in research funding, the 3rd largest among all universities in the United States.[7] As the flagship institution of the six public universities in Washington State, it is known for its research in medicine, science, as well as its highly-competitive computer science and engineering programs. Additionally, Washington continues to benefit from its deep historical ties and major collaborations with numerous technology giants in the region, such as Amazon, Boeing, Nintendo, and particularly Microsoft. Paul G. Allen, Bill Gates and others spent significant time at Washington computer labs for a prior venture before founding Microsoft.[8] Its 22 varsity sports teams are also highly competitive, competing as the Huskies in the Pac-12 Conference of the NCAA Division I, representing the United States at the Olympic Games, and other major competitions.[9]

The University has been affiliated with many notable alumni and faculty, including 20 Nobel Prize laureates and numerous Pulitzer Prize winners, Fulbright Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, as well as members of other distinguished institutions.

History

The original University building, c. 1870.
Founding
In 1854, territorial governor Isaac Stevens recommended the establishment of a university in the Washington Territory. Prominent Seattle-area residents, including Methodist preacher Daniel Bagley, saw this as a chance to add to the city's potential and prestige. Bagley learned of a law that allowed United States territories to sell land to raise money in support of public schools. At the time, Arthur A. Denny, an early founder of Seattle and member of the territorial legislature, aimed to increase the city's importance by moving the territory's capital from Olympia to Seattle. However, Bagley eventually convinced Denny that the establishment of a university would assist more in the development of Seattle's economy. Two universities were initially chartered, but later the decision was repealed in favor of a single university in Lewis County provided that locally donated land was available. When no site emerged, Denny successfully petitioned the legislature to reconsider Seattle as a location in 1858.[10]


Territorial University students in 1864
In 1861, scouting began for an appropriate 10 acres (4 ha) site in Seattle to serve as a new university campus. Arthur and Mary Denny donated eight acres, while fellow pioneers Edward Lander, and Charlie and Mary Terry, donated two acres on Denny's Knoll in downtown Seattle.[11] More specifically, this tract was bounded by 4th Avenue to the west, 6th Avenue to the east, Union Street to the north, and Seneca Streets to the south.


Grammar, Class of 1883
John Pike, for whom Pike Street is named was the architect and builder.[12] On November 4, 1861, the university opened as the Territorial University of Washington. The legislature passed articles incorporating the University, and establishing its Board of Regents in 1862. The school initially struggled, closing three times: in 1863 for low enrollment and again in 1867 and 1876 due to funds shortage. Washington successfully awarded its first graduate Clara Antoinette McCarty Wilt in 1876, with a bachelor's degree in science.

19th century relocation
By the time Washington State entered the Union in 1889, both Seattle and the University had grown substantially. Washington's total undergraduate enrollment increased from 30 to nearly 300 students, and the campus's relative isolation in downtown Seattle faced encroaching development. A special legislative committee, headed by UW graduate Edmond Meany, was created to find a new campus to better serve the growing student population and faculty. The committee eventually selected a site on the northeast of downtown Seattle called Union Bay, which was the land of the Duwamish, and the legislature appropriated funds for its purchase and construction. In 1895, the University relocated to the new campus by moving into the newly built Denny Hall. The University Regents tried and failed to sell the old campus, eventually settling with leasing the area. This would later become one of the University's most valuable pieces of real estate in modern-day Seattle, generating millions in annual revenue with what is now called the Metropolitan Tract. The original Territorial University building was torn down in 1908, and its former site now houses the Fairmont Olympic Hotel.

The sole-surviving remnants of Washington's first building are four 24-foot (7.3 m), white, hand-fluted cedar, Ionic columns. They were salvaged by Edmond S. Meany, one of the University's first graduates and former head of its history department. Meany and his colleague, Dean Herbert T. Condon, dubbed the columns as "Loyalty," "Industry," "Faith", and "Efficiency", or "LIFE." The columns now stand in the Sylvan Grove Theater.[13]

20th century expansion
Organizers of the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition eyed the still largely undeveloped campus as a prime setting for their world's fair. They came to an agreement with Washington's Board of Regents that allowed them to use the campus grounds for the exposition, surrounding today's Drumheller Fountain facing towards Mount Rainier. In exchange, organizers agreed Washington would take over the campus and its development after the fair's conclusion. This arrangement led to a detailed site plan and several new buildings, prepared in part by John Charles Olmsted. The plan was later incorporated into the overall UW campus master plan, permanently affecting the campus layout.

Both World Wars brought the military to campus, with certain facilities temporarily lent to the federal government. Regardless, subsequent post-war periods were times of dramatic growth for the University.[14] The period between the wars saw a significant expansion on the upper campus. Construction of the Liberal Arts Quadrangle, known to students as "The Quad," began in 1916 and continued to 1939. The University's architectural centerpiece, Suzzallo Library, was built in 1926 and expanded in 1935. After World War II, further growth came with the G.I. Bill. Among the most important developments of this period was the opening of the School of Medicine in 1946, now consistently ranked as the top medical school in the United States. It would eventually also led to the University of Washington Medical Center, ranked by U.S. News and World Report to be among the top ten hospitals in the nation.

During this era, many Japanese Americans were sent away to internment camps along the west coast, as part of Executive Order 9066 following the attacks on Pearl Harbor. Many Japanese American students and "soon-to-be" graduates were unable to receive diplomas, or be recognized for accomplishments at the University, until Washington's commemoration ceremony for the Japanese Americans entitled The Long Journey Home, in May 2008.

From 1958-1973, the University of Washington saw tremendous growth in students, faculties, operating budget, and prestige under leadership of Charles Odegaard. UW student enrollment had more than doubled to 34,000 as the baby boom generation came of age. However, this era was also marked by high levels of student activism, as was the case at many American universities. Much of the unrest focused around civil rights and opposition to the Vietnam War.[15][16] In response to anti-Vietnam War protests by the late 1960s, the University Safety and Security Division became the University of Washington Police Department.[17]

Odegaard instituted a vision of building a "community of scholars", convincing the Washington State legislatures to increase their investments towards the University. Washington senators, such as Henry M. Jackson and Warren G. Magnuson, also used their political clout to build research funds for UW. The results included an operating budget increase of $37 million in 1958 to over $400 million in 1973, and solidified UW as a top recipients of federal research funds in the United States even today. Establishment of technology giants such as Microsoft, Boeing and Amazon near UW has also proved to be highly influential, not only improving graduate prospects,[18][19] but also helping to attract millions of dollars in university and research funding through its extensive list of distinguished faculty and alumni network.[20]

21st century
In 1990, the University of Washington opened additional campuses in Bothell and Tacoma. Although originally intended for students who have already completed two years of higher education, both schools have transitioned into four-year, degree-granting universities. The first freshman class for these campuses came in the fall of 2006, and both campuses now offer a selection of master's degree programs as well. In 2012, the University began exploring plans and governmental approval to expand the main Seattle campus, which includes significant increases in student housing, teaching facilities for the growing student body and faculty, as well as expanded public transit options.

The UW station, completed in March 2015,[21] connects Seattle's Capitol Hill to the UW Husky Stadium within 5 minutes of rail travel time.[22] It represents a previously unavailable option of transportation into and out of the campus, designed specifically to reduce dependence on private vehicles, bicycles and local King County buses.

Campus
Main article: Campus of the University of Washington
UW's main campus is situated in Seattle, by the shores of Union and Portage Bays with views of the Cascade Range to the east, and the Olympic Mountains to the west. The site encompasses 703 acres (2.84 km2) bounded by N.E. 45th Street on the north, N.E. Pacific Street on the south, Montlake Boulevard N.E. on the east, and 15th Avenue N.E. on the west.

Red Square is the heart of the campus, surrounded by landmark buildings such as Suzzallo Library, the Broken Obelisk, and the statue of George Washington. It functions as the central hub for students, and hosts a variety of events annually. University Way, known locally as "The Ave", lies nearby and is a focus for much student life at the university.

North Campus
North Campus features some of UW's most recognized landscapes as well as landmarks, stretching from the signature University of Washington Quad directly north of Red Square to N.E. 45th Street,[23] and encompasses a number of the University's most historical academic, research, housing, parking, recreational and administrative buildings. With UW's continued growth, administrators proposed a new, multimillion-dollar, multi-phase development plan in late 2014 to refine portions of the North Campus, renovating and replacing old student housing with new LEED-certified complexes, introducing new academic facilities, sports fields, open greenery, and museums.[24][25] The UW Foster School of Business, School of Law, and the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, which houses a significant number of exhibits including a 66-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex fossil skull - one of only 15 known to exist in the world today and part of an ongoing excavation, are also located in North Campus.[26][27][28]

South Campus
South Campus occupies the land between Pacific Street and the Lake Washington Ship Canal. The land was previously the site of the University Golf Course but was given up to construct a building for the School of Medicine.[29] Today, South Campus is the location of UW's health sciences and natural sciences facilities, including the UW Medical Center and the Magnuson Health Sciences Center as well as locations for instruction and research in oceanography, bioengineering, biology, genome sciences, hydraulics, and comparative medicine.

East Campus
The East Campus area stretches east of Montlake Boulevard to Laurelhurst and is largely taken up by wetlands and Huskies sports facilities and recreation fields, including Husky Stadium, Hec Edmundson Pavilion, and Husky Ballpark. While the area directly north of the sports facilities is home to UW's computer science and engineering programs, which includes computer labs once used by Paul G. Allen and Bill Gates for their prior venture before establishing Microsoft,[8] the area northeast of the sports facilities is occupied by components of the UW Botanic Gardens, such as the Union Bay Natural Area, the UW Farm, and the Center for Urban Horticulture. Further east is the Ceramic and Metal Arts Building and Laurel Village, which provides family housing for registered full-time students. East Campus is also the location of the UW light rail station.

West Campus
West Campus consists of mainly modernist structures located on city streets, and stretches between 15th Avenue and Interstate 5 from the Ship Canal, to N.E. 41st Street. It is home to the College of Built Environments, School of Social Work, Fishery Sciences Building, UW Police Department as well as many of the University's residence halls and apartments, such as Stevens Court, Mercer Court, Alder Hall and Elm Hall.

Organization and administration

Governance
University of Washington's President Ana Mari Cauce was selected by the Board of Regents, effective October 13, 2015.[30] On November 12, 2015 the Board of Regents approved a five-year contract for Cauce, awarding her yearly compensation of $910,000. Cauce's compensation package includes an annual salary of $697,500, $150,000 per year in deferred compensation, an annual $50,500 contribution into a retirement account, and a $12,000 annual automobile allowance.[31] She was the Interim President prior to her appointment, fulfilling the position left vacant by the previous President Michael K. Young when he was announced to be Texas A&M University's next President on February 3, 2015.[32] Phyllis Wise, who had served at UW as Provost and Executive Vice President, and as Interim President for a year, was named the Chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in August 2011.[33]

The University is governed by ten Regents, one of whom is a student. Its most notable former regent is likely William H. Gates, Sr., the father of Bill Gates. The undergraduate student government is the Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW) and the graduate student government is the Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS).

Finances
In 2017 the University reported $4.893 billion in revenues and $5.666 billion in expenses, resulting in an operating loss of $774 million. This loss was offset by $342 million in state appropriations, $443 million in investment income, $166 million in gifts, and $185 million of other non-operating revenues.[34] Thus, the University's net position increased by $363 million in 2017.[34]

Endowment
Endowed gifts are commingled in the University's Consolidated Endowment Fund, managed by an internal investment company at an annual cost of approximately $6.2 million.[34] The University reported $443,383,000 of investment income in fiscal year 2017.[34] As of 31 December 2017 the value of the CEF was $3.361 billion, with $686 million in Emerging Markets Equity, $1.235 billion in Developed Markets Equity, $383 million in Private Equity, $185 million in Real Assets, $54 million in Opportunistic, $535 million in Absolute Return, and $283 million in Fixed Income.[35]

Major projects
Major recent spending includes $131 million on the UW Animal Research and Care Facility, $72 million on the Nano-engineering and Sciences Building, $61 million building on the Workday HR & Payroll System, $50 million on the Denny Hall Renovation, $44 million on the West Campus Utility Plant, $26 million on the UW Medical Center Expansion Phase 2, $25 million on the UW Tacoma Urban Solutions Center, and $21 million on the UW Police Department.[34] The initial contract for Workday was for $27 million, so the total $61 million cost represents a $34 million cost overrun.[36] As of 28 April 2018, the University has nearly $1 billion in new construction underway.[37]

Sustainability
Environmental sustainability has long been a major focus of the University's Board of Regents and Presidents. In February 2006, the UW joined a partnership with Seattle City Light as part of their Green Up Program, ensuring that all of Seattle campus' electricity is supplied by and purchased from renewable sources.[38] In 2010, then UW President Emmert furthered the University's efforts with a host of other universities across the U.S., and signed the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment.[39] UW created a Climate Action Team,[40] as well as an Environmental Stewardship Advisory Committee (ESAC) which keeps track of UW's greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint.[41] Policies were enacted with environmental stewardship in mind, and institutional support was provided to assist with campus sustainability.[42]

Additionally, UW's Student Housing and Food Services (HFS) office has dedicated several million dollars annually towards locally produced, organic, and natural foods. HFS also seized the use of foam food containers on-campus, and instead opted for compostable cups, plates, utensils, and packaging whenever possible. New residence halls planned for 2020 are also expected to meet silver or gold LEED standards.[43] Overall, the University of Washington was one of several universities to receive the highest grade, "A-", on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card in 2011.[44] The University was one of 15 Overall College Sustainability Leaders, among the 300 institutions surveyed.[45]

Rankings and reputation
UW is a globally recognized flagship university, as reflected in its strong performance across global rankings. It has been listed as a "Public Ivy" in Greene's Guides since 2001,[57] and is an elected member of the American Association of Universities.[58] Among the faculty by 2012, there have been 151 members of American Association for the Advancement of Science, 68 members of the National Academy of Sciences, 67 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 53 members of the Institute of Medicine, 29 winners of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, 21 members of the National Academy of Engineering, 15 Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators, 15 MacArthur Fellows, 9 winners of the Gairdner Foundation International Award, 5 winners of the National Medal of Science, 7 Nobel Prize laureates, 5 winners of Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research, 4 members of the American Philosophical Society, 2 winners of the National Book Award, 2 winners of the National Medal of Arts, 2 Pulitzer Prize winners, 1 winner of the Fields Medal, and 1 member of the National Academy of Public Administration.[59][60][61] Among UW students by 2012, there were 136 Fulbright Scholars, 35 Rhodes Scholars, 7 Marshall Scholars and 4 Gates Cambridge Scholars.[62] UW is recognized as a top producer of Fulbright Scholars, ranking 2nd in the US in 2017.[63]

The Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) has consistently ranked UW as one of the top 20 universities worldwide every year since its first release.[64] In 2017, UW ranked 13th worldwide out of 500 by the ARWU, 25th worldwide out of 981 in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and 26th worldwide out of 101 in the Times World Reputation Rankings.[65] Meanwhile, QS World University Rankings ranked it 61st worldwide, out of over 900.

U.S. News & World Report's Best Global Universities ranked UW as top 10th worldwide, out of 1,000 in 2018. Nationally, UW's undergraduate program was tied for 56th out of 310, and among public universities was tied for 18th out of 133. As for graduate programs, UW was ranked as follows in 2017:

Best in primary care and family medicine,
	 2nd best in library and information sciences and clinical psychology,
	 3rd best in social work and biostatistics,
	 4th best in public affairs,
	 6th best in computer science, nursing and public health
	 Other nationally competitive UW graduate programs include statistics at 7th, pharmacy and education at 9th, engineering at 25th, business at 27th, and law at 30th — also referred to as a competitive "Tier 1" school.[66]

	 As for other rankings: In 2010, Top American Research Universities, published by The Center for Measuring University Performance of Arizona State University, ranked the University of Washington 11th among the top 50 American universities.[67] In 2011, UW was ranked 8th globally among 2,000 universities in University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP) published by Middle East Technical University.[68] Top 200 Colleges and Universities in the World, published by 4 international colleges and universities, ranked UW at 8th globally in 2012.[69] In 2017, the Leiden Ranking, which focuses on science and the impact of scientific publications among the world's 500 major universities, ranked UW 12th globally and 5th in the US.[70][71]

	 Washington is also recognized in more specific domains. In 2012, the Wall Street Journal's SmartMoney named UW 6th best in salary returns on tuition.[72] In 2014, Kiplinger magazine's "Best Values in Public Colleges" named UW 11th for in-state students, and 28th for out-of-state students.[73] In 2012, the U.S. Peace Corps ranked UW 2nd among large U.S. universities, based on the number of undergraduate alumni serving as volunteers.[74] In the Washington Monthly National University Rankings, UW was ranked 8th domestically in 2017.[75]

	 Admissions
	 The University's undergraduate admissions process is rated 91/99 by the Princeton Review meaning highly selective,[76][77] and is classified "more selective" by the U.S. News & World Report.[78] For Fall 2016, 19,733 were accepted out of 43,517 applications.[79] Among the 6,475 admitted freshman students who then officially enrolled for Fall 2016, SAT scores averaged 1840, out of 2400. More specifically, the middle 50% ranged from 610-700 for evidence-based reading and writing, and 600–740 for math.[79][80] ACT composite scores for the middle 50% ranged from 26–32, out of 36.[79] The middle 50% of admitted GPA ranged from 3.68–3.94, typically out of 4.0.[79]

	 The University uses capacity constrained majors,[81] a gate-keeping process that requires most students to apply to an internal college or faculty. New applications are usually considered once or twice annually, and few students are admitted each time.[82] The screening process is often stringent, largely being based on cumulative academic performance, recommendation letters and extracurricular activities.[83] Capacity constrained majors have been criticized for delaying graduation and forcing good students to reroute their education. In April 2018, the University began to collaborate with students to address these problems and improve University access for all.[84]

	 Research
	 As a large flagship university, UW's research budget consistently ranks among the top 5 in both public and private universities in the United States.[85][86] It surpassed the $1.0 billion research budget milestone in 2012,[87] and university endowments reached almost $3.0 billion by 2016.[88] UW is the largest recipient of federal research funding among public universities, and currently ranks top 2nd among all public and private universities in the nation.[89]


	 In 2014, teams from the University of Washington School of Oceanography and the UW Applied Physics Laboratory successfully completed construction of the first high-power underwater cabled observatory in the United States.

	 To promote equal academic opportunity, especially for people of low income, UW launched Husky Promise in 2006. Families of income up to 65 percent of state median income or 235 percent of federal poverty level are eligible. With this, up to 30 percent of undergraduate students may be eligible. The cut-off income level that UW set is the highest in the nation, making top quality education available to more people. Then UW President, Mark Emmert, simply said that being "elitist is not in our DNA".[90][91] "Last year, the University of Washington moved to a more comprehensive approach [to admissions], in which the admissions staff reads the entire application and looks at grades within the context of the individual high school, rather than relying on computerized cutoffs."[92]

	 UW was the host university of ResearchChannel program (now defunct), the only TV channel in the United States dedicated solely for the dissemination of research from academic institutions and research organizations.[93] Participation of ResearchChannel included 36 universities, 15 research organizations, two corporate research centers and many other affiliates.[94]

	 In 2019, iDefense reported that Chinese hackers had launched cyberattacks on dozens of academic institutions in an attempt to gain information on technology being developed for the United States Navy.[95] Some of the targets included the University of Washington.[95] The attacks have been underway since at least April 2017.[95]

	 University of Washington had 46,081 total enrollments as of Autumn 2016, making it the largest university on the west coast by student population in spite of its selective admissions process.[98] It also boasts one of the most diverse student bodies within the US, with approximately 33% of its undergraduate students being members of minority groups.[99][100]

	 Organizations

	 The Husky Union Building, one of many facilities for student resources.
	 Registered groups
	 The University of Washington boasts over 800 active Registered Student Organizations (RSOs), one of the largest networks of any universities in the world. RSOs are dedicated to a wide variety of interests both in and beyond campus. Some of these interest areas include academic focus groups, cultural exchanges, environmental activities, Greek life, political/social action, religious discussions, sports, international student gatherings by country, and STEM-specific events. Prominent examples are:

Student government
Main article: Associated Students of the University of Washington

The Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW) is one of two Student Governments at the University of Washington, the other being the Graduate and Professional Student Senate. It is funded and supported by student fees, and provides services that directly and indirectly benefit them. The ASUW employs over 72 current University of Washington students, has over 500 volunteers, and spends $1.03 million annually to provide services and activities to the student body of 43,000 on campus.[104] The Student Senate was established in 1994 as a division of the Associated Students of the University of Washington. Student Senate is one of two official student governed bodies and provides a broad-based discussion of issues. Currently, the ASUW Student Senate has a legislative body of over 150 senators representing a diverse set of interests on and off campus.[105]

The ASUW was incorporated in the State of Washington on April 20, 1906.[106] On April 30, 1932 the ASUW assisted in the incorporation of University Book Store[107] which has been in continuous operation at the same location on University Way for over 70 years. The ASUW Experimental College, part of the ASUW, was created in 1968 by several University of Washington students seeking to provide the campus and surrounding community with a selection of classes not offered on the university curriculum.[108]
Publication
Main article: The Daily of the University of Washington

The student newspaper is The Daily of the University of Washington, usually referred to as The Daily. It is an award-winning publication, and it is the second largest daily paper in Seattle. The Daily is published every day classes are in session during fall, winter and spring quarters, and weekly during summer quarters. In 2010, The Daily launched a half-hour weekly television magazine show, "The Daily's Double Shot," on UWTV Channel 27. The UW continues to use its proprietary UWTV channel, online and printed publications.[109] The faculty also produce their own publications for students and alumni.

	Housing
	Main article: Housing at the University of Washington
	The University operates one of the largest campuses of any higher education institution in the world. Despite this, growing faculty and student count has strained the regional housing supply as well as transportation facilities. Starting in 2012, UW began taking active measures to explore, plan and enact a series of campus policies to manage the annual growth. In addition to new buildings, parking and light rail stations, new building construction and renovations have been scheduled to take place through 2020.[111] The plan includes the construction of three six-story residence halls and two apartment complexes in the west section of campus, near the existing Terry and Lander Halls, in Phase I, the renovation of six existing residence halls in Phase II, and additional new construction in Phase III. The projects will result in a net gain of approximately 2,400 beds. The Residence Hall Student Association (student government for the halls) is the second largest student organization on campus and helps plan fun events in the halls. For students, faculty, and staff looking to live off-campus, they may also explore Off-Campus Housing Affairs.[112]

	The Greek System at UW has also been a prominent part of student culture for more than 115 years. It is made up of two organizational bodies, the Interfraternity Council (IFC) and the Panhellenic Association. The IFC looks over 34 fraternities with 1900+ members and Panhellenic consists of 19 sororities and 1900 members. The school has additional Greek organizations that do not offer housing and are primarily special interest.

	Disability resources
	In addition to the University of Washington's Disability Resources for Students (DRS) office, there is also a campus-wide DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) Center program that assists educational institutions to fully integrate all students, including those with disabilities, into academic life. DO-IT includes a variety of initiatives, such as the DO-IT Scholars Program, and provides information on the 'universal' design of educational facilities for students of all levels of physical and mental ability.[113] These design programs aim to reduce systemic barriers which could otherwise hinder the performance of some students, and may also be applied to other professional organizations and conferences.[114]

	Athletics
	Main article: Washington Huskies
	UW students, sports teams, and alumni are called Washington Huskies, and often referred to metonymically as "Montlake," due to the campus's location on Montlake Boulevard N.E.[115] (although the traditional bounds of the Montlake neighborhood do not extend north of the Montlake Cut to include the campus.) The husky was selected as the school mascot by the student committee in 1922, which replaced the "Sun Dodger", an abstract reference to the local weather.

	The University participates in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I-A, and in the Pac-12 Conference. The football team is traditionally competitive, having won the 1960 and 1991 national title, to go along with eight Rose Bowl victories and an Orange Bowl title. From 1907 to 1917, Washington football teams were unbeaten in 64 consecutive games, an NCAA record.[116] Tailgating by boat has been a Husky Stadium tradition since 1920 when the stadium was first built on the shores of Lake Washington. The Apple Cup game is an annual game against cross-state rival Washington State University that was first contested in 1900 with UW leading the all-time series, 65 wins to 31 losses and 6 ties. College Football Hall of Fame member Don James is a former head coach.


	The Hec Edmundson Pavilion hosts basketball and volleyball events.
	The men's basketball team has been moderately successful, though recently the team has enjoyed a resurgence under coach Lorenzo Romar. With Romar as head coach, the team has been to six NCAA tournaments (2003–2004, 2004–2005, 2005–2006, 2008–2009, 2009–2010 and 2010–2011 seasons), 2 consecutive top 16 (sweet sixteen) appearances, and secured a No. 1 seed in 2005. On December 23, 2005, the men's basketball team won their 800th victory in Hec Edmundson Pavilion, the most wins for any NCAA team in its current arena.

	Rowing is a longstanding tradition at the University of Washington dating back to 1901. The Washington men's crew gained international prominence by winning the gold medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, defeating the German and Italian crews much to the dismay of Adolf Hitler who was in attendance.[117] In 1958, the men's crew deepened their legend with a shocking win over Leningrad Trud's world champion rowers at the Moscow Cup, resulting in the first American sporting victory on Soviet soil,[118][119] and certainly the first time a Russian crowd gave any American team a standing ovation during the Cold War.[120] The men's crew have won 46 national titles[121] (15 Intercollegiate Rowing Association, 1 National Collegiate Rowing Championship), 15 Olympic gold medals, two silver and five bronze. The women have 10 national titles and two Olympic gold medals. In 1997, the women's team won the NCAA championship.[121] The Husky men are the 2015 national champions.

	Recent national champions include the softball team (2009), the men's rowing team (2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2009, 2007), NCAA Division I women's cross country team (2008), and the women's volleyball team (2005). Individually, Scott Roth was the 2011 NCAA men's Outdoor Pole Vault and 2011 & 2010 NCAA men's Indoor Pole Vault champion. James Lepp was the 2005 NCAA men's golf champion. Ryan Brown (men's 800 meters) and Amy Lia (women's 1500 meters) won individual titles at the 2006 NCAA Track and Field Championships. Brad Walker was the 2005 NCAA men's Outdoor and Indoor Pole Vault champion.

	The University has an extensive series of sports facilities, including but not limited to the Husky Stadium (football, track and field), the Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion (basketball, volleyball, and gymnastics), Husky Ballpark (baseball), Husky Softball Stadium, The Bill Quillian Tennis Stadium, The Nordstrom Tennis Center, Dempsey Indoor (Indoor track and field, football) and the Conibear Shellhouse (rowing). The golf team plays at the Washington National Golf Club and until recently, the swimming team called the Weyerhaeuser Aquatic Center and the Husky pool home. The University discontinued its men's and women's swim teams on May 1, 2009, due to budget cuts.[122]

	Husky Stadium

	The rebuilt Husky Stadium, in 2016.
	Main article: Husky Stadium
	The rebuilt Husky Stadium is the first and primary source of income for the completely remodeled athletic district. The major remodel consisted of a new grand concourse, underground light-rail station which opened on March 19, 2016,[123] an enclosed west end design, replacement of bleachers with individual seating, removal of track and Huskytron, as well as the installation of a new press box section, private box seating, football offices, permanent seating in the east end zone that does not block the view of Lake Washington. The project also included new and improved amenities, concession stands, and bathrooms throughout. The cost for renovating the stadium was around $280 million, and was designed for a slightly lower seating capacity than its previous design, now at 70,138 seats.

	Besides hosting national and regional football games, the Husky Stadium is also used by the University for its annual Commencement event, departmental ceremonies, and other events. Husky Stadium is one of several places that may have been the birthplace of the crowd phenomenon known as "The Wave". It is claimed that the wave was invented by Husky graduate Robb Weller and UW band director Bill Bissel in October 1981, for an afternoon game facing opponents from Stanford University.

	Mascot
	Main article: Harry the Husky
	The University of Washington's costumed mascot is Harry the Husky. "Harry the Husky" performs at sporting and special events, and a live Alaskan Malamute, currently named Dubs, has traditionally led the UW football team onto the field at the start of games. The school colors of purple and gold were adopted in 1892 by student vote. The choice was inspired by the first stanza of Lord Byron's The Destruction of Sennacherib:[124][125]

	     The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
		      And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
     And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
	      When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.


		  The costumed mascot, Harry the Husky, at a basketball game.
		  Additionally, the University has also hosted a long line of Alaskan Malamutes as mascots. The dogs were originally cared for by the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity; This arrangement was followed by a 49-year tradition (1959–2008) of care by the Cross family (a UW professor, followed by his son). The 13 dogs thus far are as follows:

		  Frosty I (1922–29)
	Frosty II (1930–36)
	Wasky (1946)
	Wasky II (1947–53)
	Ski (1954–57)
	Denali (1958)
	King Chinook (1959–68)
	Regent Denali (1969–80)
	Sundodger (1981–91)
	King Redoubt (1992–97)
	Prince Redoubt (1998)
	Spirit (1999–2008)
	Dubs (2009–2019)
	Dubs II (2019- )
	School songs
	The University of Washington Husky Marching Band performs at many Husky sporting events including all football games. The band was founded in 1929, and today it is a cornerstone of Husky spirit. The band marches using a traditional high step, and it is one of only a few marching bands left in the United States to do so. Like many college bands, the Husky band has several traditional songs that it has played for decades, including the official fight songs "Bow Down to Washington" and "Tequila", as well as fan-favorite "Africano".

	Notable alumni and faculty
	Main article: List of University of Washington people

The University of Washington
Founded in 1861, the University of Washington has 46,000 students (31,500 undergraduate and 14,500 graduate/professional) and 4,350 instructional faculty divided into 16 schools and colleges. The University's annual operating budget is roughly $7 billion (inclusive of the UW Medicine health care system), roughly 5% of which comes from the State.

Arial view of campus The University of Washington is one of the nation's premier research-intensive universities. For more than 40 years, UW has ranked annually among the top five institutions in federal research obligations. The UW faculty includes more than 120 members of the National Academies, fourteen MacArthur Fellows, five winners of the National Medal of Science, and six Nobel Prize winners; four UW students have won Rhodes Scholarships in the past decade. Programs from across the campus are ranked among the best in their fields.
 

Computer Science & Engineering at UW
Computer Science & Engineering was established at the University of Washington as an inter-college graduate program in 1967. In 1975 an undergraduate program in Computer Science was added and departmental status was conferred. A second undergraduate program, in Computer Engineering, was added in 1989 when the department moved to the College of Engineering, and a Professional Master's Program was added in 1996, and a combined Bachelors/Masters program in 2008. In 2017 - our 50th anniversary year - the University of Washington Board of Regents voted to create the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, elevating our status within the university and linking us in perpetuity with the internationally renowned investor, philanthropist and computing pioneer. The Allen School currently has roughly 80 full-time faculty, 100 technical and administrative staff members, 400 graduate students (250 in the full-time program and 150 in the Professional Masters Program), and 1,300 undergraduate students (growing to award more than 450 Bachelors degrees per year). The Allen School's Computer Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET.

 Humanities quadrangle in spring The Allen School is widely regarded as among the top 10 CSE programs in the nation. Thirty-nine current faculty members have won Presidential/NSF Young Investigator Awards or NSF CAREER Awards. Six faculty members are ONR Young Investigator Award recipients. Five - plus five former faculty - have held NSF Presidential Faculty Fellow or Presidential Early Career (PECASE) Awards. Twenty-five have held Sloan Research Fellowships. Among current and emeritus senior faculty are nine Fulbright recipients, three Guggenheim recipients, twenty Fellows of the ACM, fourteen Fellows of the IEEE, two Fellows of the International Association for Pattern Recognition, five Fellows of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, three Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, four Fellows of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, three recipients of ACM or IEEE Field Awards, three MacArthur Fellows, four (plus one Adjunct) Allen Distinguished Investigators, and four (plus ten Adjunct/Affiliate) Members of the National Academies.

 Within the University, five faculty members have received the University of Washington Distinguished Teaching Award, two have received the University of Washington Marsha L. Landolt Distinguished Graduate Mentor Award, two have received the University of Washington Outstanding Public Service Award, one has received the David B. Thorud Leadership Award, one was named the University of Washington Annual Faculty Lecturer, and three have received the College of Engineering Faculty Achievement Award.

 Drumheller fountain

 In 1999, we received the inaugural UW Brotman Award for Instructional Excellence - in essence, a departmental distinguished teaching award (see our "Reflective Statement" here). In 2000, David Notkin received the UW Distinguished Graduate Mentor Award. Thirteen faculty members hold endowed positions.

 We strive to maintain a highly effective graduate program, two strong undergraduate programs, and an open and inclusive culture with minimal partitioning either vertically (between faculty ranks or between faculty and students) or horizontally (between research areas).

 The Graduate Program
 Shilshole marina at sunset
 Roughly 250 students are enrolled in the Allen School's full-time graduate program. We typically award 25 Ph.D. degrees and 50 Masters degrees each year.

 We are able to offer admission to roughly 7.5% of those who apply to our graduate program. Our recent Ph.D. graduates have received offers from essentially every top academic program and industrial research laboratory, and dozens of our recent graduates populate these strong programs.

 In addition, we offer a Professional Masters Program that is designed for fully-employed professionals in the region's information technology industry. This program features a mix of distance learning and evening courses. It enrolls roughly 150 students from more than two dozen leading companies in the greater Seattle area, and grants an additional 45 Masters degrees per year.

 UW also offers an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in Computational Molecular Biology involving several departments in the biological and mathematical sciences, including Computer Science & Engineering.

 The Undergraduate Program
 Red Square in the fall
 CSE offers two Bachelors degrees: a Computer Science degree offered through the College of Arts & Sciences, and a Computer Engineering degree offered through the College of Engineering and accredited by ABET. Together, these programs are growing to award 450+ degrees annually. 

 We additionally participate in the Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences program with our colleagues from Applied Mathematics, Mathematics, and Statistics. There is also an optional Data Science Specialization for those students majoring in Computer Science who are interested in developing a foundation in one of the fastest-growing areas of the field. Our introductory course sequence, CSE 142 / CSE 143, enrolls more than 3,500 students annually from across the campus.

 Because the demand for our undergraduate major programs exceeds the capacity, students are admitted on a competitive basis. Our undergraduates are wonderfully strong, classes are small, and interaction with the faculty is high. Undergraduate participation in research is common. Intensive capstone design courses are a hallmark of our undergraduate major programs; several recent offerings are highlighted in these videos.

 The Allen School is among the top suppliers of students in the nation to leading high-tech firms such as Microsoft, Amazon.com, and Google. In addition, we are the leading supplier to many regional companies. Because Washington State has a vibrant computing industry, roughly 90% of our graduates remain in-state. In the course of their education, the vast majority of our undergraduates participate in co-ops or internships, which we feel enhance the effectiveness of an undergraduate engineering education.

 Allen School students have received the Rhodes Scholarship, Goldwater Scholarship, Marshall Scholarship, Gates Cambridge Scholarship, and Google Anita Borg Scholarship. Within the University of Washington, our students have dominated the University Medals and Dean's Medals.  Since 2000, fully one-third of the annual high scholarship medals awarded by the University have gone to CSE majors - our "fair share" is 2%.   In the past decade, 10 winners of the annual Dean's Medals awarded to the top graduates in Arts & Science and in Engineering have gone to CSE majors. In the past decade, 33 of our students have been recognized in the Computing Research Association's Undergraduate Research Award competition - the most of any program in the nation.

 The Puget Sound Region
 The Puget Sound region is increasingly prominent as a national and international technology center. Key strengths of the University of Washington include medicine, biotechnology, the physical sciences, the marine and environmental sciences, and computing and allied areas of science and engineering.

 Pike Place Market and Elliot Bay
 Adjacent to the University of Washington are a number of major R&D facilities with which we have close ties, such as Microsoft Research, Google Seattle and Google Kirkland, Amazon.com, Adobe Advanced Technology Labs, Lee Hood's Institute for Systems Biology, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

 Strong collaborations exist among these groups, with the Allen School playing a major role in the University and the region. Our annual Affiliates Meeting is a forum for interaction among 75 leadership companies from the region and the nation. Our professional Masters degree program and our colloquium series (broadcast on UWTV and live on the Internet) play significant roles in keeping the region's leading-edge workforce current. Working with UW Educational Outreach, we offer more than a dozen "Extension Certificate Programs" that generated roughly 5,000 course enrollments during the most recent year.

 Downtown Seattle and Mount Rainier
 We are actively involved with regional leadership organizations such as the Washington Technology Industry Association and the Technology Alliance.

 Seattle, consistently acclaimed as one of the most livable cities in the nation, is a terrific place to be. Seattle is a cosmopolitan city situated in the midst of the beauty and diversity of the Pacific Northwest. The University of Washington is located on Lake Washington, a few miles east of Puget Sound. The Cascade Mountains are one hour to the east; the Olympic Peninsula and Olympic Mountains are two hours to the west.

 The Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering
 Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science and Engineering
 In Autumn 2003, UW CSE moved to the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering. The Allen Center is a true public/private partnership, funded by the State of Washington, the University of Washington, and more than 250 friends and alumni. The six-story (plus basement) building increases CSE's total space by a factor of 2.5, and our laboratory space by a factor of 3; it affords sweeping views of Lake Washington, the Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, and the Space Needle.

							* Requirements of colleges other than Arts and Sciences are based on these, but may differ. Students who have not chosen a major are advised to follow the College of Arts and Sciences requirements.
						
Language Skills

							To receive a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, students whose first enrollment in college (whether at the UW or elsewhere) was in autumn quarter 1985 or later are required to complete 5 credits of English composition with a minimum 2.0 grade. They must also complete coursework through the end of the first-year college sequence in a foreign language, with a 2.0 or higher grade in the third-quarter course, or demonstrate equivalent proficiency  through one of the following: successful completion of the third-year or higher level of high school language instruction (effective autumn 2009); by passing an examination; or by receiving a passing grade in a qualifying course beyond the first-year level. Credits used for these two requirements (including the entire first year of foreign language, if taken) cannot also be applied to the Areas of Knowledge requirements described below.
						
Reasoning and Writing in Context

							Students who first entered college autumn quarter 1985 or later must complete a minimum of 5 credits in Quantitative or Symbolic Reasoning (QSR) and 10 credits of additional composition courses or courses that emphasize the development of writing skills in the context of an academic discipline (W courses). QSR and writing courses, if they apply, can also be counted toward Areas of Knowledge or major requirements. The writing requirement is in addition to the English composition requirement mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
						
Areas of Knowledge

							The Areas of Knowledge requirement is the means by which the student develops a breadth of knowledge. Undergraduate courses are currently divided broadly into three categories: Visual, Literary, & Performing Arts; Individuals & Societies; and the Natural World. Each student must select at least 20 credits in courses from each of the three fields and an additional 15 credits from any courses in the three fields. Of the 75 total credits required, 15 may be from courses in the student's major department.
						
Course Designators

							The following symbols, included in course descriptions in this catalog, indicate which, if any, of the above requirements are fulfilled by certain courses:
						

VLPA -- Visual, Literary, & Performing Arts (Area of Knowledge requirement)
						

I&S -- Individuals & Societies (Area of Knowledge requirement)
						

NW -- The Natural World (Area of Knowledge requirement)
						

QSR -- Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning
						

							Courses that meet the foreign-language requirement and the additional-writing requirement are not marked. The third-quarter (or second-semester) course in any language meets the language requirement, so long as the entire first-year sequence totals at least 12 credits (regardless of whether the student earned credit for the earlier parts of the sequence). Consult the quarterly Time Schedule for writing-intensive courses that meet the additional-writing requirement.
						
Major

							In fulfilling the requirements for a major, the student engages in thorough study of a discipline or subject, aimed at developing knowledge in depth. This part of the student's program is determined by the department, school, or faculty committee with which the major study is pursued. Measured in academic credits, the "major" required of each student consists of 50 or more prescribed credits in a department of the College or a closely related group of departments. Descriptions of major programs are shown below.
						
Minor

							Completion of a minor, available through many departments, is optional. Requirements are shown under individual department undergraduate programs, below, or in a minors handout available in UAA Advising, 141 Mary Gates Hall. The following interdisciplinary minors are also offered: Arctic Studies; Disability Studies; Diversity; Education, Learning, and Society; Human Rights; Labor Studies; Marine Biology; Paleobiology; and Values in Society.  Websites for these minors may be found in the alphabetical listing of Arts and Sciences degree programs. 
						
Credits Required Outside Major Department

							So that the student does not overspecialize, the College limits to 90 the number of credits from a single department that the student may elect to count in the 180 credits required for the baccalaureate degree. A department itself can require no more than 70 credits from courses within the department, and no more than 90 credits from within the department and related fields combined, as constituting its major program for the baccalaureate degree. Exceptions to these restrictions may be granted by the Dean.
						
GPA Required for Graduation

							To be eligible to receive the baccalaureate degree, the student must achieve at least a 2.00 cumulative GPA in the major (some departments prescribe a higher minimum GPA for the major), as well as a 2.00 cumulative GPA for all work done in residence through the University.
						
Applying for Graduation

							Students should apply for the baccalaureate degree no later than the first quarter of their final year. Seniors who apply by announced quarterly deadlines receive Graduating Senior Registration Priority (GSP), allowing them to register first for the following quarter. GSP status is limited to two quarters.
						

							All current and past UW students may graduate under the College requirements published in this catalog. Students may use the department requirements in effect at the time they are admitted to the major, if they graduate within 10 years of that time. Otherwise, the department may insist on more recent major requirements. Students wishing to fulfill a previous set of requirements should see an adviser for details and options. All responsibility for fulfilling graduation requirements rests with the student concerned.
						
Limits on Physical Education Courses Allowed Toward Graduation

							A student graduating from the College of Arts and Sciences may count a maximum of three credits of 100-level physical-education activity courses taken at the University of Washington, or their equivalents at other collegiate institutions, as elective credits toward graduation. At present, physical-education courses are not offered at the University.
						



Evening Degree Program


							Students may earn a degree in communication, English, health informatics and health information administration, humanities, or social sciences through the Evening Degree Program. Admission to the humanities and social sciences majors is on hold for the 2014-2015 academic year.  Admission to the other programs requires the following: 75 college credits, normally to include Arts and Sciences language-skills requirements (English composition and foreign language), the reasoning-in-context requirement (quantitative/symbolic reasoning), and a substantial portion of the writing-in-context and general education requirements. Students who have only a few remaining prerequisite courses to complete may, under certain circumstances, be admitted as premajors. Admission and graduation requirements for communication (only the general communication option is offered) and English are identical to requirements for the day programs, shown under departmental listings. 
						

							Admission
						

							Admission to the humanities and social sciences majors is on hold for the 2014-2015 academic year.
						
Major Requirements

							The humanities major and the social sciences major require a minimum 2.00 GPA for all courses taken in residence at the UW and a minimum 2.25 GPA for courses taken to satisfy the major requirements.
						


Humanities -- 60 credits, including at least 30 credits from one of the following three options: communication and critical thinking; literature and culture; ideas and beliefs in social history. A 5-credit senior seminar. Remaining credits from courses outside the principal option.
							

Social Sciences -- 60 credits, including 15 credits of social science survey courses (e.g., ANTH 202, SOC 271, POL S 202); 25 credits from one of the following four options: social and ethical theory; law, politics, and the state; culture and ethnicity; economy and ecology. 15 credits of program electives (selected from courses outside the principal option). A 5-credit senior seminar. Major requirements are to include at least 40 credits in 300- and 400-level courses.
							


							For course lists, consult the Evening Degree Program adviser (at Evening Degree Program, 103 Lewis Hall) or UAA Advising, 141 Mary Gates Hall.
						

							Requirements for Health Informatics and Health Information Administration are available through the Evening Degree Program.
						



Graduate Study


							Students who intend to work toward advanced degrees must apply for admission to the Graduate School and must meet the general requirements outlined in this General Catalog, as well as the requirements established by the graduate faculty in the department or unit offering the degree program. Graduate students must satisfy the requirements for an advanced degree in force at the time the degree is to be awarded.

Anthropology



Overview
Undergraduate
Graduate




Department Overview
314 Denny

							Anthropology is the study of human beings in all their cultural and biological diversity. It includes the study of human evolution, the archaeological record, language and culture, the relationship between humans and their environment, and cultural modes of being as these differ in time and space. In studying anthropology, students can better understand how to find ways to live together in today's world, respecting cultural diversity while building upon common human values.
						

							Study of anthropology at the University of Washington comprises three sub-disciplines:
						


Archaeology is the study of the human past through investigation of material remains (artifacts, food remains, features, structures, etc.) and their relationships in space and time.
							

Biological anthropology focuses on understanding human variation through the study of the ecological, demographic, genetic, developmental, paleontological, and epidemiological dimensions of modern human adaptation and its evolutionary basis.
							

Sociocultural anthropology is the study of human societies, their cultures and histories, and the circuits of power and exchange that link them to the world at large.  
							


							Study at the undergraduate level can further entail any of four optional tracks: Medical Anthropology and Global Health, Anthropology of Globalization, Archaeological Sciences, and Human Evolutionary Biology.

							Graduate courses in solar system, stellar, galactic, and extragalactic astrophysics are offered. The heart of the program, collaboration of students and faculty members in research at the frontiers of astronomy, involves developing techniques and insight necessary for successful research and, subsequently, defining a thesis topic. Thesis research may use theoretical, computational, or observational material (obtained through facilities of the UW or one of the national ground- or space-based observatories, or a combination). Active research programs in observations and theory are carried out in a variety of areas, including astrobiology and extrasolar planets, interplanetary dust and comets, stellar atmospheres and interiors, stellar evolution and populations, interacting binary stars and compact objects, interstellar matter and nebulae, computational astrophysics and data mining, galaxies and quasars, large scale structure and cosmology, and dark matter and energy. 
						

							Doctor of Philosophy
						

							Admission Requirements
						

							Most entering students have a bachelor's degree in physics. Entering students are not required to have a background in astronomy, although some knowledge of general astronomy is expected of those to whom a teaching assistantship is offered. Interested undergraduates are urged to concentrate on preparation in physics and mathematics before entering.
						

							Visit www.astro.washington.edu/grad for details on admission requirements.  Most application material is submitted through the Graduate School online application.
						

							Degree Requirements
						

							90 credits minimum, to include the following:
						

							Typically PhD students take formal courses during their first two years at the UW while sampling research projects with various faculty. Areas covered include planetary astronomy, stellar interiors and atmospheres, interstellar medium, galaxies, dynamics, cosmology, physical processes, observational astronomy, and a variety of special topics.  Early on, students may embark on faculty-supervised research programs. 
						

Core Curriculum: Typical core courses include ASTR 507, ASTR 519, ASTR 521, ASTR 531, ASTR 557, ASTR 561 in one year, and ASTR 508, ASTR 509, ASTR 511, ASTR 512, ASTR 513, ASTR 541 in the alternate year, along with ASTR 500 and ASTR 581 (latter two often offered annually).  In addition, each quarter students take a third course emphasizing additional physical or mathematical science study or astronomical research.   
						

Examinations: (1) Qualifying written examination covering general knowledge, taken and passed by the end of the third year. (2) General examination, an oral examination on a topic related to a student's proposed PhD research topic. 
						
Dissertation: Students begin PhD research after passing the general examination, typically in the third or fourth year at UW.  Most students complete the PhD thesis and defense two to three years later. 
						

							A master of science degree is offered but the department is not currently accepting students for a master's-only program. Students typically earn the master's degree as part of the PhD program. The departmental requirements for a master's degree are either (1) adequate performance on the qualifying exam or (2) an approved and supervised master's thesis.
						

							Assistantships
						

							Normally all students making satisfactory academic progress receive financial support. More than three-quarters of the department's graduate students hold fellowships or research assistantships. Teaching assistantships are available, primarily in elementary astronomy courses.

Biology



Overview
Undergraduate
Graduate




Department Overview

							106 Kincaid
						

							Biology is the broadly based study of living organisms and has become an increasingly dynamic and wide-ranging discipline. It may be approached by focus on cell and molecular processes, development, organismal physiology and morphology, natural history, evolution, conservation, or ecology. The aim is to elucidate general principles applicable to many different sorts of organisms rather than to concentrate on any particular taxonomic group. Biology is often interdisciplinary in nature and may involve aspects of biochemistry, botany, genetics, microbiology, zoology, and many other natural sciences.
						




Undergraduate Program

							Student Outcomes and Opportunities
						


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: The department graduates between 350 and 400 students each year. Biology degrees are applicable to many different fields, depending upon student interests. Students in the program gain analytical and laboratory skills that prepare them for entry-level positions in a variety of biologically related areas, including, but not limited to, biotechnology, laboratory and/or field research support, health science support, wildlife biology, and ecology and conservation work with a variety of agencies, consulting firms, and research organizations in the Northwest. Students may enter graduate programs that focus on some aspect of biological science (such as genetics, microbiology, immunology, ecology, environmental health, or cell and molecular biology), or enter a variety of professional programs, such as veterinary medicine, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, laboratory medicine, and nursing.
							

Instructional and Research Facilities: The Department of Biology occupies 128,000 square feet in Hitchcock, Johnson, and Kincaid Halls. Extensive research laboratories, teaching laboratories, computer workstations, and support services are found throughout the department.
								
									Specialized facilities include more than 16,000 square feet of greenhouse, seawater facilities, growth rooms, electron microscopes, and other specialized equipment. Undergraduates have access to most of these facilities, especially those engaged in undergraduate research.
								

									Off campus, the internationally recognized Marine Research Station, Friday Harbor Laboratories, provides many opportunities for undergraduates, from courses to research apprenticeships.
								


Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements.
							

Research, Internships, and Service Learning: Biology faculty welcome undergraduates into their research programs, often working closely with them. Approximately 40 percent of the 900 undergraduate biology majors finish with undergraduate research experience.
								
									UW proximity to such Seattle area organizations as the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Swedish Hospital, numerous biotech companies, NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Research Center, the Seattle Aquarium, and the Woodland Park Zoo, as well as the close ties of Biology faculty to Friday Harbor Laboratories and the faculty in the College of the Environment provide opportunities for biology majors to develop internships within these organizations. See adviser for ways to get credit for such experiences.
								


Department Scholarships: Several scholarships are available, in a few cases to biology majors only. Most of these support students wishing to pursue an undergraduate research experience. They are competitive, sometimes highly so. They include:
								

Howard Hughes Undergraduate Research Internship: approximately 20 per year for freshmen and 20 per year for juniors and seniors.
									

Friday Harbor Laboratory (FHL) Apprenticeships: $3,000 for one quarter, spring or autumn.
									

Mary Gates Scholarships: very competitive, across all science disciplines.
									

Herschel and Caryl Roman Scholarship: $2,500-$5,000 annually to one or two students who have an interest in genetics research.

Program Overview

								B-531 Padelford
							

								The department offers opportunities to explore connections - connections among various literary, visual, and cultural traditions in a global world; connections between past and present; and connections across different academic disciplines and modes of intellectual inquiry.
							

								Comparative literature trains students in the critical analysis of texts, seeking to understand how the rhetorical and aesthetic features of those texts - whether literary, visual, or theoretical â negotiate and shape social values, attitudes, and beliefs.  International in scope and interdisciplinary in orientation, the field emphasizes intellectual breadth and fosters intellectual initiative by maximizing studentsâ opportunities to design their own courses of study.

Classics

Department Overview

								218 Denny
							

								The discipline of classics concerns itself with the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome from prehistoric times to the Middle Ages. The department is concerned with the Greek and Latin languages and their literatures, including poetry, drama, history, philosophy, rhetoric, and political theory, as well as with classical art and archaeology. The ancient cultures of Greece and Rome hold an extraordinary place in the American past and present, thanks to their central role in forming the basic conceptual categories that shape our intellectual, professional, and civic lives. The vast temporal and geographic gulf that divides these ancient cultures from modernity brings students and scholars of classics face to face with the otherness of antiquity and forces a critical examination of our own cultural roots.

								The Department of Classics offers the following programs of study:
							


									The Bachelor of Arts degree with majors in classics, Greek, Latin, and classical studies.
								

									Minors in classical studies, Greek, Latin, and classics and ancient history.
								


								The majors in classics, Greek, and Latin emphasize the development of expertise in Greek and Latin and can include coursework in the history, literature, philosophy, science, and the art and archaeology of these two contrasting but related cultures. Students who intend to continue their studies to the PhD degree are advised to take the BA in classics or, alternatively, the BA in Latin or Greek with as many courses in the second language as possible.
							

								A fourth major, the Bachelor of Arts with a major in classical studies, is especially suited to students wishing to explore the literature, history, art, archaeology, and philosophy of classical antiquity, primarily through English translations. The classical studies major demands less study of the classical languages of Greece and Rome than is required for the other majors. Students with no previous exposure to Greek or Latin can complete the classical studies major in two years. Students have often combined this major with another major such as English, history, or art history, and even with a non-humanities major such as computer science, biochemistry, or economics.
							

								Bachelor of Arts
							

Suggested First- and Second-Year College Courses: First- and second-year Latin and/or classical Greek, classics in translation, ancient history, classical art and archaeology, ancient philosophy.

								Student Outcomes and Opportunities
							


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: The undergraduate study of classics emphasizes critical analysis of language and culture and clear and effective writing. The BA with a major in classics is a respected terminal degree in itself. Like other degree programs in the humanities, it emphasizes the acquisition of those analytic and communications skills which are indispensable for careers in government, journalism, law, industry, medicine, and business. The classics major (especially in its more language-intensive forms) is often a mark of distinction when a graduate applies for admission to professional school.
									
										Many who take the bachelor's degree in classics go on to pursue graduate work in the subject at leading PhD programs. Graduates include winners of prestigious national awards such as Mellon Fellowships for graduate study and the Rhodes Scholarship.
									




Instructional and Research Facilities: The departmental office provides access to several computers for research and coursework. The Classics Department sponsors numerous lectures by distinguished speakers visiting from universities in this country and abroad; undergraduates are always welcome to attend.
								

									Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors). With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements.
								

Research, Internships, and Service Learning: None offered.
								

Department Scholarships:


Jim Greenfield Undergraduate Scholarship is intended for undergraduate majors in classics. The object of the Jim Greenfield scholarship is to enable exceptionally well-qualified students to devote the maximum time and energy to their study of the classics at the University of Washington.

Successful candidates may reapply for the following year.
										

Jim Greenfield Undergraduate Travel Bursaries: Jim Greenfield Undergraduate Travel Bursaries may be used for the department's Rome program, for travel associated with participation in archaeological excavations, for independent travel to areas of classical interest, or for other kinds of study-related travel for which the applicant can make a cogent case. In some cases an award might allow a student to remain overseas for study travel in the wake of the department's Rome Program. Further information about applying for a Jim Greenfield Undergraduate Travel Bursary is available in the department office.
										

											In addition to the above, undergraduates are eligible to apply or be nominated for:

Overview

							AC101 Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science and Engineering
						

							UW Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) educates students to become leaders in the design and implementation of the computing systems that touch every aspect of modern society. CSE is widely recognized as one of the top programs in the world, with passionate faculty bringing the latest advances into the classroom and the lab.
						

							CSE offers two undergraduate degrees: Computer Science (through the College of Arts & Sciences) and Computer Engineering (through the College of Engineering). While the degree requirements differ in some details, undergraduate majors working toward either degree have the same broad opportunities to take the wide array of courses that CSE offers. Many of our graduates go on to careers at the world's great technology companies, from the largest industry titans to the smallest start-ups. Others join innovative companies and non-profit organizations outside the traditional computing industry to use software, hardware, and data to solve the world's greatest challenges. Still others go on to challenging graduate programs in a variety of fields.
						

							At the graduate level, CSE offers (1) an integrated Master's program for some of our undergraduate majors seeking a deeper education before leaving campus, (2) an evening Master's program for currently employed software professionals, and (3) a Ph.D. program for students seeking a research career.
						

							The field of computing is broad and growing, and CSE's course catalog reflects this breadth. Beyond the popular introductory programming courses taken by thousands of students from every major on campus, our courses cover everything from the mathematical foundations of what computers can and cannot do; to hands-on experiences building software and hardware artifacts with a range of programming languages and tools; to advanced courses in software engineering, human-computer interaction, computer graphics and animation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, large-scale data management, natural language processing, computer networking, computational biology, robotics, computer security and privacy, and much more.
						

							Computers are the most flexible and powerful machines ever created. While the applications of computing continue to grow and change, the core magic of CSE is timeless: computer scientists and engineers combine creative problem-solving, rigorous design, and the creation of algorithms, software, and hardware systems to build solutions that change the world.

							The Department of Computer Science and Engineering offers the following programs of study:
						


								The Bachelor of Science degree with a major in computer science
							

								The Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering degree (see Computer Engineering section)
							


							The core requirements of the two undergraduate majors are similar. The computer science major may be more appropriate for students who want to earn a double major with another College of Arts and Sciences program, who want the additional flexibility of the computer science requirements (the computer engineering major has more required courses and fewer electives), or who may be primarily interested in the design of software systems and applications.
						

							The computer engineering major includes a general foundation in engineering fundamentals to enable interdisciplinary work with other departments in the College of Engineering and the University as a whole.  It may be more appropriate for students who are interested in building systems that include both hardware and software components and that must be engineered to meet a variety of cost and performance constraints.

Program Overview

								207 Raitt
							

								The processes of inquiry encompassing imagination, exploration, discovery, and reflection are universal among artists, scholars, scientists, and engineers. All seek to uncover new knowledge through innovations that improve our lives and communicate new ways of understanding ourselves and the universe. The Center for Digital Arts and Experimental Media (DXARTS) is a creative research convergence zone for intrepid artists and scholars who are pioneers of an unfolding new era in the arts.
							

								The DXARTS program embraces an expansive range of arts practice, theory, and research across multiple disciplines. The center is home to its own graduate degree program, but welcomes into its facilities and courses many who are not directly affiliated with this program. Faculty and students at DXARTS may focus their work in a particular area of experimental arts (digital video, digital media art, computer music and sound art, computer animation, design computing, mechatronics, and so on), or they may pursue areas of creative research that have no media allegiance overlapping with and drawing from several or many different areas. Whatever the case, artists and scholars working at DXARTS engage in teaching, learning, and research within the synergistic, multidisciplinary setting of the center's labs, studios, and classrooms. 
							

								A common thread running through all of the work at DXARTS is the implicit maxim that to discover new knowledge we must challenge all assumptions. DXARTS is a place where the ideas and outcomes of creative arts research are in an ongoing state of becoming.

								The program in Law, Societies, and Justice provides an interdisciplinary liberal arts education focusing on the roles of law and law-like systems in structuring social life. Courses challenge students to understand the multiple forms of law  criminal, civil, administrative, and constitutional  and the multiple roles law plays in the conduct of social action.  Courses stress the importance of examining law in comparative perspective, and of recognizing the increasing significance of rights discourse in shaping how law is understood and practiced.  Faculty are trained in several social science disciplines, and hence students learn to analyze law from multiple perspectives.

								Student Outcomes and Opportunities
							


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: The Law, Societies, and Justice curriculum emphasizes the development of a range of analytic and communicative skills. Courses challenge students to develop the capacities to: read and interpret texts, including theoretical, empirical, and legal documents; comprehend and contrast arguments; develop and defend arguments; contrast theoretical arguments with empirical realities; assess contemporary practices of justice delivery against contemporary conceptions of justice. Students are required to express these skills in both verbal and written forms, through active class discussions and well-constructed writing assignments. Development of these skills assists students in a range of possible future endeavors, including a wide array of careers in law and justice.
								

Instructional and Research Facilities: Students have access to the Political Science/Law, Societies, and Justice/School of International Studies writing center for most classes. Research opportunities are available on an individual and group basis with many professors. 
								

Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements. 
								

Research, Internships, and Service Learning: LSJ requires each of its majors to complete an internship for credit.  Internship aims: (1) to provide students with insights into the workings of law in practice; (2) to scrutinize and 'test' some of the theories and concepts found in the literature against 'real world' practice; (3) to advance career development and goals, and (4) to provide 100 hours of local community service.  Student assignments vary, and include government agencies, non-profit social service organizations, private law firms, rights-focused organizations, and other sites that focus on issues connected to LSJ coursework. It is the student's responsibility to find an internship, although the LSJ adviser can help find a suitable one. Students are required to write two papers according to specific guidelines for internship course credit. 
								

										Many LSJ faculty regularly invite majors to assist them in the development and execution of research endeavors. These provide students an unparalleled opportunity to understand the challenges and mechanics of high-level research.
									



Department Scholarships: The Stromberg Study Abroad Fund provides financial assistance to LSJ majors who pursue Study Abroad opportunities in socio-legal studies. 
								

Student Organizations/Associations: The Law, Societies, and Justice Student Association sponsors regular events of interest to LSJ students, including career panels and service events. 
								


Of Special Note: The required departmental seminar emphasizes close reading of texts, active class discussions, and well-reasoned analytic writing, providing an opportunity to establish a close connection to faculty and other students, and to hone analytic and communicative skills.

									The undergraduate program of study in English concentrates on developing students' critical and interpretive abilities with regard to literatures written in English. Students become familiar with the critical developments in the study of language and literary forms, including especially understanding the cultural and historical contexts of various forms of literature. Students are, accordingly, asked to cultivate a habit of self-conscious and careful reading of written texts. Honing a successful habit of reading depends on acquiring an early awareness of the broad range of critical and interpretive methods available to readers of literature, as well as comprehending the basic purpose and effects at stake in different reading methods. Finally, students develop the ability to compose effective and persuasive written analyses of texts in a manner that demonstrates comprehension of the complexities or nuances of language, literature, and culture.

Program Overview

								171 Mary Gates Hall
							

								Individualized Studies is an interdisciplinary major option for students who wish to create a program of study by combining selected courses from two or more departments. Students are required to identify a central organizing theme for their major and design it under the guidance and supervision of at least two faculty members and an Individualized Studies adviser.
							




Undergraduate Program


								Adviser
								 171 Mary Gates Hall, Box 352805

								The Individualized Studies program offers the following programs of study:
							


									Bachelor of Arts with a major in Individualized Studies
								

									Bachelor of Science with a major in Individualized Studies
								

									Degree depends on the theme and curriculum of the approved major.
								


								Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science
							

Suggested First- and Second-Year College Courses: Varies, depending on student's area of concentration.
							

								Program Admission Requirements
							

								Before developing an Individualized Studies major, students should read "Designing an Individualized Studies Major," or obtain a copy from the UAA Advising, 141 Mary Gates Hall. Particular attention should be paid to the sections defining restrictions on themes and restricted access to courses. Individualized Studies majors are not possible in a number of subjects because the UW does not offer sufficient coursework. Upper-division courses in departments with competitive admission are generally not available to students not in that major and ordinarily cannot be included in Individualized Studies proposals.
							

								After reading the guidelines, the student must go through the following steps to design a major:
							


									Identify the unifying interdisciplinary theme of the program.
								

									Make a list of courses taken or planned to be taken toward this goal. This list should comprise between 50 and 70 quarter credits, all of which are related to the area of concentration. These courses must come from at least two departments, but may come from any number of areas, so long as interrelationships are discernible. Most courses must be at the 300- or 400-level. At least half the 50-70 credits selected for the major must come from courses taught within the College of Arts and Sciences.
								

									Draft a statement that describes the proposed major and discusses the interrelationships among the courses chosen. Propose a brief, descriptive title for the major.
								

									Submit the proposal to the Individualized Studies Committee for initial approval. Prospective majors should submit proposals to the Individualized Studies Committee for review at least three quarters prior to graduation.
								

									Identify at least two faculty sponsors for the major. The faculty sponsors attest to the intellectual soundness of the proposal and agree to provide whatever guidance is jointly decided upon. They may also suggest changes in the previously approved written proposal or list of courses.
								

									Obtain final approval from an Individualized Studies adviser.
								

									Transfer students must be enrolled at the UW before applying to the major.
								

									For admission requirements for the technical writing option, see an adviser. 
								


								Major Requirements
							

								55 to 70 credits, including completion of the approved curriculum and a 5-credit required senior study (minimum grade of 2.7 required for senior study). Awarding of the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree depends on the content of each student's program.
							

								Student Outcomes and Opportunities
							


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: Varies, depending on student's area of concentration.
								

Instructional and Research Facilities: None
								

Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements.

At least 15 credits of upper-division geography courses must be taken through the UW.
						

							Student Outcomes and Opportunities
						


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: Geographers address some of the worlds most urgent challenges, including global and environmental change, economic and social inequality and poverty, world hunger, global health and healthcare, social justice in the city, migration and immigration, and what it means to be a global citizen in the twenty-first century.  Responses to such questions are complex and partial, and these issues are not fixable by one-dimensional solutions. Geographys contribution to these public issues and solutions is through evidence-based, multi-scalar analyses and mapping of socio-spatial and environmental change.  Social justice, community engagement and activism, and an accountability to place inform our inquiry and study.
										
										
											In geography classes students learn how to design and conduct research, employing quantitative and qualitative methods; use statistical and demographic analysis; and interpret and analyze data, discourses, and texts and images in order to address significant topics and questions in human geography. Students combine classroom study with internships, community service, and independent research to develop integrated, rich, and relevant learning experiences. These experiences help develop and refine critical and analytical research and communication skills, offer hopeful and engaged responses to daunting problems, and emphasize that individuals can make a difference.
										

											Typical questions or lines of inquiry in each track include:
										


Cities, Citizenship, and Migration: Why do people move, and where do they go?  What are the constraints and opportunities for migrants as they settle and integrate in new cities and new nations?  How are cities formed and what are the forces that impact their economic and cultural development?  The courses in this track focus on themes of urbanization and human movement, emphasizing the importance of labor and housing, as well as cultural processes and historical forms of discrimination that shape where people live and work.  Students in this track develop an understanding of the intersections of power and place as they pertain to migration and immigrant life, citizenship and belonging, and the production of urban space.
												

Environment, Economy, and Sustainabilty: Courses in this track study the reciprocal and often contradictory forces of economic activity, environmental policy, and sustainability.  Using such key geographic concepts as scale, place and location, they analyze relations between such complex processes as: land use, labor markets, corporate location, international trade, energy policy and consumption, environmental regulatory policy, resource use, and food systems.
												

Globalization, Health, and Development How does globalization shape life and death around the planet? How can development initiatives address global health disparities? Providing geographical answers to such questions, this track traces the extraordinarily uneven effects of global trade, global finance, and market-led development on food systems, health, and the geography of impoverishment.  By putting global health challenges in a global socio-economic context, the track simultaneously highlights how social movements and social organizing can make a difference, including differences in formal policies affecting human well-being directly as well as innovations in the ethics of care. Courses in the track provide frequent opportunities for service learning as part of the goal of helping students engage with real world challenges.   All classes also approach these themes through a geographical lens: charting global-local relations and the links between nature, society, and political-economy in particular places. This geographical approach in turn enables us to explore how nutrition, health, and development are intertwined with other processes ranging from the personal experiences of migrant farm workers, to urban and regional redevelopment, to global financial reforms.  Specific questions that frame our classes include: What are the links between life and debt (GEOG 123)? How have sixty years of development increased in-country inequality (GEOG 230)?  How do global disease etiologies reflect other global interconnections (GEOG 280)? How does agricultural modernization relate to hunger (GEOG 371)? And what are the implications for food security, health security, and developmental security when they are re-framed in terms of geopolitics and the global security challenges of international relations (GEOG 375)?
												

GIS, Mapping, and Society In courses that comprise the GIS, Mapping, and Society track, students learn to use GIS, web-based geospatial applications, and database management systems for problem solving in relation to a diverse range of societal concerns, such as those within the other geography tracks. Students learn a range of analytical and critical methods for cartographic representation, spatial analysis, geovisualization, and database management.  Further, students learn about the politics, ethics, and values of mapping and geospatial technologies, and integrate their social and technical skills to undertake projects with research partners in the region.
														
												


										Graduates have pursued careers as urban planners, environmental planners and land-use analysts, GIS analysts, economic analysts (marketing, location, geo-demographics), public health researchers, NGO specialists in developing nations, airline route analysts, import-export/international-trade specialists, real estate valuation specialists, lawyers, economic development specialists, social studies teachers, and college professors.
									


Instructional and Research Facilities: A map center in Suzzallo Library houses atlases, sheet maps, and aerial photographs. Departmental facilities include the Edward L. Ullman Geography Collaboratory and the John C. Sherman Laboratory, which houses a variety of computer workstations connected to the campus computer network. The Ullman Collaboratory in 415 Smith provides a unique collaborative classroom with networked computer work stations. The Geography Commons also provides computer work stations for students. The Department of Geography is a member of the Center for Social Science Computation and Research, which maintains an extensive data archive and offers many statistical and software consulting services.
							

Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements.
							

Research, Internships, and Service Learning: More than 125 geography students participate each year in internships. For lists of these opportunities, see the department's career site.
							

Department Scholarships: None offered.
							

Student Organizations/Associations: The Undergraduate Geography Association (UGA) organizes field trips, alumni career panels, public-service projects, and social gatherings.
							


Of Special Note: Students interested in GIS are encouraged to learn a high-level programming language such as C, C++, Java, or Visual Basic.

							Student Outcomes and Opportunities
						


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: The study of history enhances critical thinking and writing skills. It is a creative process in which students learn to use arguments and evidence to communicate a sound historical thesis. It is a liberal arts degree that encourages students to become well rounded, educated people. Graduates are prepared for a variety of careers in many professions and businesses. In addition to teaching, research, and museum and archives work, recent graduates have pursued careers as political lobbyists, journalists, and law enforcement officers. Many history majors pursue, and are well prepared for, further education and professional programs such as medicine, law, library science, and museum curatorship.
							

Instructional and Research Facilities: The department funds a writing center for students enrolled in history courses. The department also has a small computer laboratory available for history majors.
							

Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Distinction (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements.

							Student Outcomes and Opportunities
						


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: Graduates of the Department of Philosophy acquire considerable skills in abstract thinking, analysis, and critical writing (constructing and critiquing arguments). Because of these skills, philosophical training is invaluable in almost any area of life. Recent graduates have been successful in software development, financial planning, journalism, teaching, and law. A few go on to graduate school and become professional philosophers.
								
									Students' work is subjected to careful critical scrutiny. As a result, students benefit from philosophy courses with an increased competence in expository clarity, logical rigor, and analytical skill.
								

									Philosophy is an excellent undergraduate major for pre-professional students. It is perhaps ideal for those who aspire to work in the legal profession. The history and philosophy of science major is of particular interest to those planning careers in the sciences. Courses in ethics offer students in any field the opportunity to think clearly about the normative dimensions of their career choices. Because the skills of philosophical analysis can be applied widely, philosophy is always a good complementary second degree for any major, whether it is in the physical sciences, social sciences, arts, or humanities.
								


Instructional and Research Facilities: The Philosophy Writing Center provides a free tutoring service to any student writing a philosophical paper. 
							

Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements.
							

Research, Internships, and Service Learning: The department offers internship credits for students participating in the philosophy of children program. Students may also arrange for internship credit with individual faculty. See adviser for details. 
							

Department Scholarships: The Kenneth Clatterbaugh scholarship acknowledges a student with financial need who has outstanding academic merit and commitment to philosophy.  The Kenneth R. Parker Award for Excellence in Community Service honors an undergraduate philosophy major or minor who has blended her or his studies in philosophy with a volunteer-based community project. The recipient receives a $500 scholarship. A donation of $250 is made on behalf of the recipient to a community organization of the student's choice. See adviser for details.
							

Student Organizations/Associations: The undergraduate student club, Lyceum, is dedicated to the informal discussion of philosophical issues. 
							


Of Special Note: The department offers a new majors seminar for those wishing to explore the major.

Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: Students investigate the social, historical, ethical, and aesthetic meanings attached to and manifested in cultural texts and artifacts. These include visual, literary, performance, and philosophical works in different forms and genres, and in different historical periods and cultural contexts. Students gain a critical understanding of developments in and approaches to the study of literary and cultural forms, as well as the processes by which they are produced, received, and used. They develop an appreciation for the complexities and nuances of language, literature, and cultural expression and communication. In learning to interpret and contextualize texts, to pose questions, to construct arguments, and to conduct effective research, students become better critical thinkers, speakers, and writers, capable of engaging cultural debates and producing new cultural knowledge. 
								
									Specific skills developed include writing in various genres; critical, analytic, and integrative thinking; textual and archival research in different media; argumentation; and effective public speaking.
								

									Humanities majors pursue widely varied careers, including education, editing, private enterprise, public administration, creative writing, management, arts administration, museology, development, and events planning.
								


Instructional and Research Facilities: Students use all university library resources and facilities corresponding with their individual research needs. In addition, each of the contributing humanities academic departments offers individual resources to majors. Check with advisers for options.
							

Honors Options Available: For Interdisciplinary Honors, see University Honors Program.
							

Research, Internships, and Service Learning: The program works collaboratively with students interested in pursuing independent study and research opportunities through academic departments that contribute to the major. Opportunities for work with the Carlson Center, Office of International Programs and Exchanges, and service learning are possible for all students.
							

Department Scholarships: The Evening Degree program awards need-based financial aid assistance each year to students from a general fund. Two additional scholarship resources are the Rodney I. Straub Endowed Scholarship and the Nicole Snyder Dettmar Endowed Scholarship.
							

Student Organizations/Associations: None at present.
							


 
Individualized Studies



Overview
Undergraduate




Program Overview

								171 Mary Gates Hall
							

								Individualized Studies is an interdisciplinary major option for students who wish to create a program of study by combining selected courses from two or more departments. Students are required to identify a central organizing theme for their major and design it under the guidance and supervision of at least two faculty members and an Individualized Studies adviser.
							




Undergraduate Program


								Adviser
								 171 Mary Gates Hall, Box 352805
								 (206) 543-2550
istudy@uw.edu


								The Individualized Studies program offers the following programs of study:
							


									Bachelor of Arts with a major in Individualized Studies
								

									Bachelor of Science with a major in Individualized Studies
								

									Degree depends on the theme and curriculum of the approved major.
								


								Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science
							

Suggested First- and Second-Year College Courses: Varies, depending on student's area of concentration.
							

								Program Admission Requirements
							

								Before developing an Individualized Studies major, students should read "Designing an Individualized Studies Major," or obtain a copy from the UAA Advising, 141 Mary Gates Hall. Particular attention should be paid to the sections defining restrictions on themes and restricted access to courses. Individualized Studies majors are not possible in a number of subjects because the UW does not offer sufficient coursework. Upper-division courses in departments with competitive admission are generally not available to students not in that major and ordinarily cannot be included in Individualized Studies proposals.
							

								After reading the guidelines, the student must go through the following steps to design a major:
							


									Identify the unifying interdisciplinary theme of the program.
								

									Make a list of courses taken or planned to be taken toward this goal. This list should comprise between 50 and 70 quarter credits, all of which are related to the area of concentration. These courses must come from at least two departments, but may come from any number of areas, so long as interrelationships are discernible. Most courses must be at the 300- or 400-level. At least half the 50-70 credits selected for the major must come from courses taught within the College of Arts and Sciences.
								

									Draft a statement that describes the proposed major and discusses the interrelationships among the courses chosen. Propose a brief, descriptive title for the major.
								

									Submit the proposal to the Individualized Studies Committee for initial approval. Prospective majors should submit proposals to the Individualized Studies Committee for review at least three quarters prior to graduation.
								

									Identify at least two faculty sponsors for the major. The faculty sponsors attest to the intellectual soundness of the proposal and agree to provide whatever guidance is jointly decided upon. They may also suggest changes in the previously approved written proposal or list of courses.

Law, Societies, and Justice



Overview
Undergraduate




Program Overview

								42 Gowen
							

								The program in Law, Societies, and Justice provides an interdisciplinary liberal arts education focusing on the roles of law and law-like systems in structuring social life. Courses challenge students to understand the multiple forms of law  criminal, civil, administrative, and constitutional  and the multiple roles law plays in the conduct of social action.  Courses stress the importance of examining law in comparative perspective, and of recognizing the increasing significance of rights discourse in shaping how law is understood and practiced.  Faculty are trained in several social science disciplines, and hence students learn to analyze law from multiple perspectives.

Linguistics



Overview
Undergraduate
Graduate




Department Overview

						Guggenheim Hall, 4th Floor
					

						Linguistics is the scientific study of language, which is one of the most characteristic human attributes. In contrast to other language-related disciplines, linguistics is concerned with describing the rule-governed structures of languages, determining the extent to which these structures are universal or language-particular, positing constraints on possible linguistic structures, and explaining why there is only a fairly narrow range of possible human languages.

						Student Outcomes and Opportunities
					


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: The study of linguistics emphasizes formal reasoning and critical thinking skills. Linguists' skill sets include the ability to analyze sound, word, and sentence structures of individual languages; the ability to understand and account for how languages change in certain patterns; the ability to understand how social factors can affect language, how people learn their first or second languages; and the ability to find out and appreciate how apparently vastly different languages can be governed by the same set of rules. Linguistics is a valuable component of liberal education and vocationally can have applications wherever language itself becomes a matter of practical concern. Graduates have a good foundation for pursuing further training and careers in teaching languages, in areas of rehabilitative medicine such as audiology or speech therapy, in special education, in work with native peoples or with immigrant groups, in lexicographic work, in interpretation and translation, in work in computer science and artificial intelligence, or in academic disciplines such as psychology, philosophy, literature and language studies, where the contribution of linguistics is recognized. An undergraduate degree in linguistics from the UW also serves as preparation for graduate work in linguistics or language-related fields such as speech and hearing science or language teaching.
						

Instructional and Research Facilities: The Language Learning Center located in Denny Hall provides audio and video services facilitating language learning. It also has a computer laboratory providing instructional software for linguistics and varieties of languages. Departmental facilities include a phonetics laboratory for students conducting phonetic experiments and doing digital acoustic analyses, a linguistics library that supplements the linguistics collection of the UW libraries and provides a quite study place, and a computer laboratory for research in computational linguistics.
						

Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of both Honors Core Curriculum and Honors requirements in the major). With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements). See adviser for requirements. 
						

Research, Internships, and Service Learning: None offered
						

Department Scholarships: None offered

Department Overview

						C138 Padelford
					

						Mathematics is both a science and an art. Like any great art, mathematics has an intrinsic beauty and coherence that has attracted practitioners for centuries. Yet, unlike other arts, mathematics is a surprisingly effective tool for describing the natural world. Indeed, mathematics has come to serve as the foundation of modern science, through its language and results. Some mathematical results were initially developed in order to solve internally generated mathematical problems and only later found application in other disciplines; other mathematical results were inspired by the needs of these other disciplines. The two facets of mathematics -- tool of science and subject of inquiry for its own sake -- have come to be interwoven into a complex fabric.

						 C36 Padelford, Box 354350
						 (206) 543-6830
grads@math.washington.edu


						The department offers the master of arts, master of science, and doctor of philosophy. Opportunities are available for study of abstract and applied mathematics for each degree program. The MAis appropriate for students who need a broad background in advanced mathematics and who expect to continue working with mathematics of approximately the same level in their careers. The  MS is appropriate for students who expect to be working with more specialized mathematics of increasing order of complexity in their careers. The PhD is appropriate for students who plan on a career of research and/or teaching of mathematics at the highest levels.

						Student Outcomes and Opportunities
					


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes:
						The department's objective is to provide a major with the best instruction possible in broad areas of microbiology so students qualify for a wide variety of positions with a terminal BS degree or qualify to pursue advanced degrees in graduate or professional schools.
					
					
						Microbiology offers students an excellent education in the biology of microorganisms, namely bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Through learning about the biology of these microorganisms and viruses, students more fully understand the pivotal position they occupy in establishing and maintaining our biosphere, their effects on human, animal, and plant life, and how the biological properties of certain microbes are exploited for certain purposes. Microorganisms are important in drinking water, wastewater and sewage treatment, production and spoilage of foods, production of antibiotics, bioremediation of toxic compounds, and genetic engineering of organisms having unique characteristics. Students gain insight into strategies used by microorganisms and viruses to cause disease and the mechanisms used by their host to defend themselves.
					

						Graduates have found research positions in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as in state and government positions hiring microbiologists. Students interested in a health profession or graduate program benefit from this program.
					

Instructional and Research Facilities: Microbiology courses are taught using state-of-the-art facilities in the teaching wing of the Health Sciences building. Research labs are located in the Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, NW Regional Primate Research Center, and UW Rosen building.
						

Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements. 
						

Research, Internships, and Service Learning: MICROM 499, undergraduate laboratory research, is offered for credit. See adviser for details.
						

Department Scholarships: The department offers four awards each year. More information is available at the department's website.
						

Student Organizations/Associations: The Microphiles Club is open to all students. The club sponsors field trips to local biotech companies, speakers on topics such as research and career opportunities, graduate school, and peer teaching.

						Admission is competitive to all music programs.

						Near Eastern languages and civilization focuses on the languages and civilizations of the Near East with an emphasis on the ancient and medieval roots of these civilizations as well as more recent cultural developments. Each language offered represents a major literary tradition. Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Central Asian Turkic are the languages of the most significant literary manifestations of Islamic civilization. Hebrew and Aramaic are the languages of the Bible and are central to Judaism and Jewish culture. Egyptian languages (Coptic, hieroglyphic) and other Mesopotamian and Mediterranean languages (Akkadian, Ugaritic, Phoenician) are important to the ancient and Christian cultures of the Near East.

						Student Outcomes and Opportunities
					


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: The NELC undergraduate degree offers a liberal arts education with a particular focus on the study of cultures and languages of the Near East and Central Asia. Educational outcomes from this degree serve a broad spectrum of undergraduates, ranging from those intending to begin the acquisition of specific linguistic and cultural proficiencies for the purpose of pursuing some career, academic or otherwise, related to these regions, to students for whom the Near East and/or Central Asia are regions with histories and cultures that are of special intellectual or personal interest. Students often combine Near Eastern studies as a double major with some other degree program that may be in a quite different discipline. For these students the NELC undergraduate major offers the important opportunity, as a core element in a broader liberal arts education, for expanding their cultural vision and understanding in ways made possible only through serious study of a language and literature other than one's own. Graduates from the BA degree have followed a wide range of post-baccalaureate paths, including further graduate study in the humanities or social sciences, professional degree programs in law or medicine, and employment with government or non-governmental organizations.
						

Instructional and Research Facilities: The department draws on collections of books, serials, and other resources in the UW libraries that are unusually rich in the quantity and quality of items relating to Near Eastern and Central Asian languages and cultures. Students in the department's language classes make use of the University's well-equipped Language Learning Center.
						

Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors core curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements. 
						

Research, Internships, and Service Learning: Undergraduate research is carried out under the supervision of faculty members. Students can also undertake research and internship opportunities while studying abroad.
						

Department Scholarships: See departmental website for most current information.
						

Student Organizations/Associations: There are no formal student organizations in the department, but the department frequently sponsors educational and cultural events organized by students and faculty involved in interest groups such as the Central Asian Circle or the Persian Circle.

							Student Outcomes and Opportunities
						


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: Graduates of the Department of Philosophy acquire considerable skills in abstract thinking, analysis, and critical writing (constructing and critiquing arguments). Because of these skills, philosophical training is invaluable in almost any area of life. Recent graduates have been successful in software development, financial planning, journalism, teaching, and law. A few go on to graduate school and become professional philosophers.
								
									Students' work is subjected to careful critical scrutiny. As a result, students benefit from philosophy courses with an increased competence in expository clarity, logical rigor, and analytical skill.
								

									Philosophy is an excellent undergraduate major for pre-professional students. It is perhaps ideal for those who aspire to work in the legal profession. The history and philosophy of science major is of particular interest to those planning careers in the sciences. Courses in ethics offer students in any field the opportunity to think clearly about the normative dimensions of their career choices. Because the skills of philosophical analysis can be applied widely, philosophy is always a good complementary second degree for any major, whether it is in the physical sciences, social sciences, arts, or humanities.
								


Instructional and Research Facilities: The Philosophy Writing Center provides a free tutoring service to any student writing a philosophical paper. 
							

Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements.
							

Research, Internships, and Service Learning: The department offers internship credits for students participating in the philosophy of children program. Students may also arrange for internship credit with individual faculty. See adviser for details. 
							

Department Scholarships: The Kenneth Clatterbaugh scholarship acknowledges a student with financial need who has outstanding academic merit and commitment to philosophy.  The Kenneth R. Parker Award for Excellence in Community Service honors an undergraduate philosophy major or minor who has blended her or his studies in philosophy with a volunteer-based community project. The recipient receives a $500 scholarship. A donation of $250 is made on behalf of the recipient to a community organization of the student's choice. See adviser for details.
							

Student Organizations/Associations: The undergraduate student club, Lyceum, is dedicated to the informal discussion of philosophical issues. 
							


Of Special Note: The department offers a new majors seminar for those wishing to explore the major.

Graduate




Department Overview

						101 Gowen
					

						Political science, broadly conceived, is the study of governments and other political actors, including their origins and foundations, interactions with groups and individuals, and interactions with nations. Within this larger framework political scientists study power, authority, conflict, economic relationships, culture, laws, policy, values, ethics, justice, equality, rights, legitimacy, and representation, to list only a few. Using these and other concepts, they analyze the political impacts of social issues such as war, peace, poverty, crime, education, the environment, race, gender, and globalization. Modes of inquiry are highly interdisciplinary.

Social Sciences (Evening Degree)



Overview
Undergraduate




Program Overview
103 Lewis Hall

This multidisciplinary major includes upper-division social science courses selected by faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences.  Students explore diverse political, social, environmental, gender, ethnic, and cultural perspectives in pursuit of their degrees.  Coursework encourages greater understanding of issues, ideas, and themes in history and in the contemporary world.  Analytical, research, and communication skills which can enhance a person's career opportunities are emphasized.

The coursework in social science is organized into three tracks:

Social and Environmental Issues
Law, Politics, and the Economy
Gender, Ethnicity, and Culture


Social and Environmental Issues addresses key ecological, environmental, and social issues of tribal, peasant, industrial, and post-industrial societies from around the world.  This track includes assessments of how technological, ecological, environmental, economic, cultural, and sociopolitical factors interact to affect the form and function of social, cultural, and political systems and institutions.  It also features courses which explain classical and contemporary theories of anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, and sociology bearing on these issues.

Law, Politics, and the Economy deals with the role and function of government, legal institutions, and economic and political processes, focusing on the complex interaction of political and economic forces which shape social life.  Important areas of study include the character of political power and inequality, law and other sources of state legitimacy, international relations and the economic interdependence of nation-states, and the role of the state in maintaining social order and ameliorating conflict within and between societies.

Gender, Ethnicity, and Culture studies the cultural, geographic, historical, political, psychological, and social factors which define, shape, and change the various peoples of the United States.  Racism, age and sex discrimination, the status and role of women, the treatment of immigrants, the emergence of classes and sociocultural interest groups, and aspects of religious movements and religious conflict are core topics.  Courses assessing theories that examine and explain these issues are also essential.

					Sociology seeks to explain social structure, social institutions, and social interaction. There are three emphases in the graduate training program: understanding and critically evaluating social theory and empirical research; doing theoretically guided research that explores, assesses, and further develops explanatory theories; and developing communication skills (with emphasis on teaching and scholarly writing) that are useful in transmitting sociological knowledge. The department has particular strengths in social and formal demography, deviance and social control, stratification and inequality, health, comparative and historical sociology, family and gender studies, and quantitative methods.
				

					Emphasis is on empirical research aimed at developing explanatory theories. Students are trained in problem formulation, research design, data gathering and analysis, and bringing data to bear on significant questions. Instruction is offered on various methods: statistical, survey, demographic and ecological, field research, and historical. Students learn social research by participating in faculty projects or developing their own studies.

Undergraduate Program

							C104 Padelford
						

							The educational philosophy of Spanish and Portuguese studies is that knowledge and understanding of other cultures is fundamental in an increasingly global world, and that competence in the languages of those cultures is an indispensable gateway to them. Spanish studies provides students with the four basic language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) in increasing levels of sophistication so that they may read and analyze works of literature written in Spanish as well as understand complex cultural structures and artifacts from Spain, Latin America, and the Latino populations of the United States. The UW offers beginning and intermediate Portuguese and all levels of Spanish.

							Student Outcomes and Opportunities
						


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: The study of Spanish and Portuguese is both skills- and content-based, i.e., it has practical and cognitive elements. Students learn to communicate in Spanish or Portuguese, refining their language skills as they acquire a body of knowledge about the literary and cultural history of Spain, Latin America, and the Spanish-speaking populations of the United States. Graduates have found these skills extremely useful as they pursue careers in teaching, business, NGOs and human rights organizations, law, and politics.
							

Instructional and Research Facilities: Departmental facilities include a Writing Center for students registered in third-year Spanish. The Center for Spanish Studies, housed in the department, is a joint initiative of the University of Washington, the Education Office of the Embassy of Spain, and the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. This center provides services that include workshops for K-12 teachers of Spanish, sponsorship of cultural events, and a lending library of books as well as audio and visual materials. A branch of the Spanish government sponsored Cervantes Institute, also housed in the department, offers linguistic and cultural resources to the university and the general community as well.
								
									The department directs three study abroad programs, in León (Spain), Oaxaca (Mexico) and Cádiz (Spain). These programs are "living laboratories." Approximately 100 students participate each year.
								


Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors). With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements. 
							

Research, Internships, and Experiential Learning: Internship opportunities are posted on the department website as they become available. Also, students may participate in experiential learning (which may include service learning), in which they combine study with service to the community. Students must volunteer two-to-five hours per week (a minimum of 30 hours per quarter) in organizations that provide services primarily, although not exclusively, to Spanish speakers. Alternatively, they may volunteer in public schools as tutors of different academic themes. Some of the organizations and schools involved include CASA Latina, The Mexican Consulate, El Centro de la Raza, Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, Cascade People's Center, Center for Spanish Studies, John Stanford International School, Bryant Elementary School, John Hay Elementary School, Hamilton Middle School, Nathan Hale High School, the Pipeline Project, and the East Side Literacy program. Students apply and increase their knowledge of the Spanish language in a real context. They are exposed to Hispanic multiculturalism and become active agents of social change in the community. 


Department Scholarships: An annual scholarship, the Susan B. Johnson Memorial Endowment Fund, is awarded to a student of Spanish for foreign study in Spain.
							

Student Organizations/Associations: None.
							


Of Special Note: 100- and 200-level Spanish courses do not count toward major/minor requirements.

Overview
Undergraduate
Graduate




Department Overview

						B309 Padelford


						Probability provides the conceptual foundation and mathematical language for the logic of uncertainty and induction. Statistics is concerned with procedures for the acquisition, management, exploration, and use of information in order to learn from experience in situations of uncertainty and to make decisions under risk. Statistical practice includes design of experiments and of sampling surveys; exploration, summarization, and display of observational data; drawing inferences, and assessing their uncertainty; and building mathematical models for systems with stochastic components.
					

						Instruction is enriched through academic contacts with the Foster School of Business; the College of Engineering; the departments of Applied Mathematics, Atmospheric Sciences, Biology, Cardiology, Computer Science, Earth and Space Sciences, Economics, Genetics, Mathematics, Psychology, Radiology, and Sociology; the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management program; the Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences; the Applied Physics Laboratory; the Applied Statistics Division of the Boeing Company; Microsoft Research; and Insightful Corporation.

Department Overview

							106 Kincaid
						

							Biology is the broadly based study of living organisms and has become an increasingly dynamic and wide-ranging discipline. It may be approached by focus on cell and molecular processes, development, organismal physiology and morphology, natural history, evolution, conservation, or ecology. The aim is to elucidate general principles applicable to many different sorts of organisms rather than to concentrate on any particular taxonomic group. Biology is often interdisciplinary in nature and may involve aspects of biochemistry, botany, genetics, microbiology, zoology, and many other natural sciences.
						




Undergraduate Program


							Adviser

bioladv@uw.edu


							The Department of Biology offers the following programs of study:
						


								The Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in biology.
							

								The Bachelor of Science degree with a major in biology. Students choose one of the following options: ecology, evolution, and conservation; general; molecular, cellular, and development; physiology; and plant.
							

								A minor in paleobiology.
							


							Designed for students desiring breadth of training, the Bachelor of Arts program does not require physics. Students do not select an emphasis, and hence have greater flexibility in upper-division biology electives. 
						

							The Bachelor of Science options are as follows:
						


Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation. Emphasizes ecological and evolutionary processes and conservation biology. Relates these areas to systematics, the distribution and abundance of organisms, and environmental policy. Prepares students for graduate study in ecology and evolution, for professional schools that seek individuals with strong system-level approaches to problem solving, and for careers in natural resources and conservation.
							

General. Emphasizes breadth of training in biology. This is the most flexible program and offers a greater variety of advanced electives than other options. Attractive to students desiring K-12 teaching credentials or who otherwise wish to tailor their degree to their needs.
							

Molecular, Cellular, and Development. Designed for students who wish to pursue graduate studies in genetics, biochemistry, microbiology, cell biology, or developmental biology, as well as for candidates for professional schools such as medicine and dentistry.
							

Physiology. Emphasizes physiological processes from the cellular to the organismal levels, and across all groups of organisms. An attractive option for students interested in graduate and professional fields in animal and human physiology, medicine, and veterinary sciences.
							

Plant. Offers students both breadth and depth of training in the field of botany. Ideal for students desiring to enter graduate programs in botany or for those wishing to pursue careers in the plant biology or horticultural fields in state and federal agencies.
							


							Each of the above bachelor's degree programs in the biological sciences can be combined with Washington State requirements to prepare students to teach biology in public schools at the secondary level. See the Biology Teaching Program adviser for specific requirements.

bainfo@uw.edu


						Advising for the first two years of the program is done through the Undergraduate Gateway Center, 141 Mary Gates Hall.
					

						The Department of Architecture offers the following programs of study:
					


							Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in architecture
						

							Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in architectural design
						

							A dual-degree program leading to the Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in architectural design and the Bachelor of Science degree in construction management
						

							A minor in architecture
						


						The Bachelor of Arts (with a major in architecture) is a four-year, undergraduate degree program in architecture in which students explore the factors that shape our built environment.  The program provides a liberal arts foundation in the discipline of architecture, which covers spatial reasoning, aesthetics, political and economic structures, socio-cultural influences, urbanism, landscape, and ecology, and gives students the opportunity to concentrate their studies through a sequence of courses investigating history and theory, materials and making, or sustainable technologies.  Students in the Bachelor of Arts (with a major in architecture) program can prepare for graduate study in architecture and related fields such as construction management, landscape architecture, real estate, and urban planning, as well as careers in other fields.
					

						The Bachelor of Arts (with a major in architecture) consists of two, two-year sequences.  Years one and two include 14 credits of preparatory architectural coursework in addition to at least 76 credits devoted to satisfying the UWs general education requirements.  These include coursework in the Visual, Literary, and Performing Arts (VLPA), Individuals and Societies (I&S), mathematics, science, and other areas of knowledge.  The intent of these first two years is to help students build their skills in communication and critical thinking; gain broad exposure to other disciplines in order to make more informed academic and career decisions; and provide the broad academic foundation essential to successful study in architecture.  All interested UW students are welcome to participate in this first two-year sequence.
					

						The second two-year sequence begins in the junior year.  Upper-division admission to the program requires the completion of architecture prerequisites and a minimum of 90 credits, and occurs through a selection process at the beginning of spring quarter of the sophomore year.  Years three and four include 29 credits of required courses, including the capstone, 38 credits of discipline-specific selectives and electives, and 23 credits of upper-division electives.  Students can focus their studies by choosing a concentration of history and theory, materials and making, or sustainable technologies, or a combination of these.
					

						The Bachelor of Arts (with a major in architectural design) is a pre-professional degree that prepares candidates for admission with advanced standing to professional architectural programs. It is also good preparation for other roles in society that benefit from an understanding of and exposure to architectural design and problem solving such as government, development, management, planning, art, graphic design, and digital arts.  Students develop visual literacy and complex problem solving through the design process, including researching historical precedents, analyzing theoretical texts, and on-site understanding of the physical built and natural environment.  International study programs (Rome, Scandinavia, India, Mexico, Japan) provide further opportunities for students to engage built environments within global/local and contemporary/historical cultural contexts.  A focus on sustainable technologies and the craft and making of architecture play an important role throughout the program.
					
						The Bachelor of Arts (with a major in architectural design) is for students who are interested in the architecture profession and who may continue their studies by earning a graduate professional degree in architecture.  The masters degree in architecture is a professional degree and generally takes two or more years to complete if the student enters with the pre-professional Bachelor of Arts (with a major in architectural design).
					

						The college also offers a design and construction concurrent degree (Bachelor of Arts with a major in architectural design, BS in construction management), awarded after completion of 225 credits. Students interested in this double degree must complete the prerequisites for the architectural design major, be admitted to architectural design, and then apply to construction management while completing the architectural design major. This is a five-year program. In addition, the College of Built Environments offers three other bachelor degrees: the BLA in landscape architecture, a five-year professional degree; the BS in construction management, a four-year professional degree; and the BA in community, environment, and planning, a four-year interdisciplinary degree.

Student Organizations/Associations: AIAS (American Institute of Architectural Students)
						


Of Special Note:


						Most states require that an individual intending to become an architect hold an architecture degree accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). The NAAB accredits three types of degrees: (1) the Bachelor of Architecture (BArch), which requires a minimum of five years of architectural study (this degree is not offered at the University of Washington), (2) the Master of Architecture (MArch), which requires a minimum of three years of study following an unrelated bachelor's degree or two years following a related pre-professional bachelor's degree, and (3) the Doctor of Architecture (this degree is not offered at the University of Washington). These professional degrees are structured to educate those who aspire to registration and licensure to practice as architects. 
					

						The UW's four-year, Bachelor of Arts degree in architectural design is a pre-professional degree and is not accredited by NAAB. The pre-professional degree is useful to those desiring a foundation in the field of architecture as preparation for either continued education in a professional degree program or for employment options in fields related to architecture.
					

						Architectural education at the University of Washington requires a minimum of six or seven years of higher education to attain the first professional degree, the Master of Architecture. The curriculum is divided into three two-year segments of coursework with a pre-professional Bachelor of Arts degree (with a major in architectural design) awarded at the completion of the second two-year segment. The professional degree, Master of Architecture, is awarded only upon completion of the third segment. (Students with the Bachelor of Arts in Architecture or bachelors degrees in unrelated fields take an additional year of coursework).

Of Special Note:


						Most states require that an individual intending to become an architect hold an architecture degree accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). The NAAB accredits three types of degrees: (1) the Bachelor of Architecture (BArch), which requires a minimum of five years of architectural study (this degree is not offered at the University of Washington), (2) the Master of Architecture (MArch), which requires a minimum of three years of study following an unrelated bachelor's degree or two years following a related pre-professional bachelor's degree, and (3) the Doctor of Architecture (this degree is not offered at the University of Washington). These professional degrees are structured to educate those who aspire to registration and licensure to practice as architects. 
					

						The UW's four-year, Bachelor of Arts degree in architectural design is a pre-professional degree and is not accredited by NAAB. The pre-professional degree is useful to those desiring a foundation in the field of architecture as preparation for either continued education in a professional degree program or for employment options in fields related to architecture.
					

						Architectural education at the University of Washington requires a minimum of six or seven years of higher education to attain the first professional degree, the Master of Architecture. The curriculum is divided into three two-year segments of coursework with a pre-professional Bachelor of Arts degree (with a major in architectural design) awarded at the completion of the second two-year segment. The professional degree, Master of Architecture, is awarded only upon completion of the third segment. (Students with the Bachelor of Arts in Architecture or bachelors degrees in unrelated fields take an additional year of coursework).

									A CEP education is fully lived, not passively taken. CEP students actively make their education in community with others. CEP class cohorts range from 25-30 students. This group comprises a community of mutual learning that requires commitment, personal investment, and strong teamwork strategies for two years. Through six interconnected, quarterly seminars students engage the core content of the major: community, environment, and planning. These contemporary academic fields and areas of research include the study of community as subject and practice, exploration of the ecological context of all societal life, and an investigation of the potentials of planning for developing strategies for positive change.
								

									CEP students have gone on to careers in a variety of interdisciplinary fields such as community planning and organization, urban development, communications, work in for-profit and nonprofit sectors, public administration, education, community and environmental activism, ecology, and government/community relations.

									The Master of Science in Real Estate degree, a demanding, interdisciplinary program, combines business management skills with an understanding of how real estate markets work and how the three-dimensional, place-bound attributes of real estate products affect their performance.  Overarching these three interdisciplinary areas of study is a focus on how behaviors of those involved in making decisions about real estate investment and development affect desired outcomes.
								

									The curriculum provides basic knowledge, core skills, and advanced understanding necessary for graduates to assume positions of leadership in the real estate industry of tomorrow.  Learning leadership skills is integral to everything a student does throughout the two years in the program.  Interdisciplinary study provides understanding of techniques and tools used in a broad range of fields essential to real estate, enabling graduates to lead collaborative efforts to solve complex problems of creating sustainable urban environments.  The limits imposed by the physical characteristics of real estate have put a premium on understanding behaviors of people involved in creating and managing real estate projects.  People make the decisions that drive values of property types.  Students explore ethical behaviors leading toward emphasis on using technology to support classroom and case learning and in applying the knowledge and leadership skills learned throughout the program. For curriculum details, see the program webisite at http://runstad.be.washington.edu.

Department Overview

						120 Architecture
					

						Construction management is a diverse discipline focused on the delivery of projects that compose the world's built environment. Included are the determination of project requirements, management of design, procurement of materials, and management of the construction of the project within cost, time, and design parameters. In terms of dollar value output, the construction industry is the largest single production activity in the U. S. economy - accounting for almost 10 percent of the gross national product. The construction industry is heterogeneous and enormously complex. The major classifications of construction differ markedly from one another: residential, commercial, industrial, and infrastructure, as well as specialties such as electrical, mechanical, framing, excavation, and roofing. Construction management is the study of how projects are conceived, designed, and built; the types of materials and methods used; techniques for estimating the cost of construction; design and contract law; construction accounting; oral and written communications; safety requirements; project planning and project management.

Department Overview

						348 Gould
					

						Landscape architecture is a professional design discipline that addresses both the built and natural environments. It focuses on the design, analysis, and planning of outdoor spaces across a wide range of scales, with the intent of creating places that are both meaningful and functional. Landscape architects design everything from infrastructure elements, such as roadways, drainage systems, and parks, to prominent cultural monuments and gardens for public and private housing units. The education of a landscape architect includes aesthetic design skills, the development of social and environmental ethics, technical design skills, knowledge of a wide range of natural processes, an awareness of design history, and skills for working with other people. At the University of Washington, the focus is on urban ecological design education, which allows students to make a difference in the future of cities and urban regions all over the world.

							Student Outcomes and Opportunities
						


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: A CEP education is founded on the following: students start where they are; articulate and embrace a vision of how they intend to make a difference in the world; construct a plan (with guidance from faculty and peers) of CEP seminars, cross-disciplinary courses, and field experiences; move deliberately with this plan in the final two years of undergraduate education; through first-hand experience and in the context of the CEP community of learners, become acquainted with effective ways for working constructively together to anticipate and address critical issues facing the complex communities and world we inhabit. 
								
									A CEP education is fully lived, not passively taken. CEP students actively make their education in community with others. CEP class cohorts range from 25-30 students. This group comprises a community of mutual learning that requires commitment, personal investment, and strong teamwork strategies for two years. Through six interconnected, quarterly seminars students engage the core content of the major: community, environment, and planning. These contemporary academic fields and areas of research include the study of community as subject and practice, exploration of the ecological context of all societal life, and an investigation of the potentials of planning for developing strategies for positive change.
								

									CEP students have gone on to careers in a variety of interdisciplinary fields such as community planning and organization, urban development, communications, work in for-profit and nonprofit sectors, public administration, education, community and environmental activism, ecology, and government/community relations.

						Men and women embarking on business careers have the opportunity to influence many of the social, political, and economic forces in today's world. The Foster School prepares students for professional careers in management and related disciplines in both the private and public sectors.
					

						The Foster School offers an undergraduate program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration (BABA) and graduate programs leading to the degrees of Master of Business Administration (MBA), Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA), Technology Management Master of Business Administration (TMMBA), Master of Professional Accounting (MPAcc), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). An evening MBA program is also offered. Additionally, the Foster School offers a Master of Science degree in Information Systems (MSIS) and a Global Executive Master of Business Adminstration (GEMBA).
					

						Business Administration became an independent unit within the University system in 1917. It has been accredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (now known as the International Association for Management Education) since 1921.
					

						Facilities and Services
					

						Most Foster School classes and activities are in four buildings.  Dempsey Hall, named for Neal and Jan Dempsey, contains the deans office, MBA and undergraduate offices, the Arthur W. Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship, MBA and undergraduate career centers as well as classrooms and an executive forum.   PACCAR Hall offers a combination of U-shaped tiered classrooms, meeting spaces, a 250-seat auditorium, student breakout rooms, faculty offices, and a soaring atrium with a café and a boardroom.  It is equipped with a wide range of technology enhancements including web-linked digital monitors and distance conferencing capabilities.  Mackenzie Hall, named in memory of Professor Donald Mackenzie, Chair of the Department of Accounting from 1949 to 1955, contains the offices of the Foster Schools Consulting and Business Development Center, the Global Business Center, the Center for Leadership and Strategic Thinking, and the Foster School Advancement and Alumni teams. A fourth building, on the northwest side of Dempsey, has three distinct components:  the Bank of America Executive Education Center (which includes the James B. Douglas Executive Forum), the Boeing Auditorium, and the Albert O. and Evelyn Foster Business Library.
					

						To serve the continuing education needs of middle- and senior-level managers, the Foster School offers a number of certificate programs, either University-initiated or co-sponsored with various community and industry organizations. The Executive Development Program, a nine-month, one night per week program, strengthens understanding and skills in all areas of management and provides an opportunity for successful managers to learn from a distinguished faculty and each other. Short courses and seminars are offered throughout the year, focusing on topics such as leadership, finance and accounting for non-financial executives, and negotiation skills. In addition, the School develops and runs custom programs under contract with individual companies and organizations.

Although the Marketing and International Business Department offers a general curriculum in international business, each of the five academic departments within the 
						Foster School maintains faculty with special international teaching and research expertise. Internationally oriented courses are offered by each department.
					

						At the undergraduate level, the Foster School offers the Certificate of International Studies in Business (CISB) program. Students in the program complete the same demanding business curriculum as other students and enhance this training with foreign language study, area studies, and an international experience. The program requires that students have a solid foundation in one of five language tracks: Chinese, French, German, Japanese, and Spanish; a sixth custom track for other languages is also an option.  In addition, there is a U.S. track for international students.  
					

						At the MBA level, the Foster School offers opportunities for MBA students to build on the international business foundation that every MBA develops through the first year of the program. In addition to international business electives, the 
						program offers overseas travel through study tours, quarter-long exchange programs, and international internships.

Undergraduate Program


						Dental hygiene seeks to understand why some people get preventable oral diseases and why others do not. Risk factors, such as poverty, ethnicity, and education, as well as environment, contribute to perpetuation of these diseases. The dental hygienist observes and defines dental diseases, assesses potential outcomes of interventions, and manages conditions that compromise oral health. As an applied discipline, dental hygiene links its theoretical foundation to behavioral and natural sciences. Using evidence-based science, the discipline seeks to facilitate holistic assessments of individuals and communities and to find solutions to oral health problems. Students in the discipline learn to transfer learning from clinical to community contexts as a means of improving the oral health status among people.

						The Dental hygiene degree completion program offers the following program of study:
					


							Bachelor of Science degree with a major in dental hygiene.
						


						The UW has no pre-licensure program in dental hygiene.
					

						Bachelor of Science
					

Suggested First- and Second-Year Courses: Students desiring entry into the dental hygiene profession may take their first-year general education courses in chemistry, psychology, sociology, public speaking, English composition, mathematics, nutrition, microbiology, and liberal studies at the UW, or another community, technical, or four-year institution. Having successfully completed a pre-licensure dental hygiene program and obtained a license to practice dental hygiene, students are eligible to return to the UW to complete the Bachelor of Science degree with a major in dental hygiene.
					

						Department Admission Requirements
					

						The dental hygiene program is not accepting new applicants. Please contact the program for further information.
					

						Major Requirements
					

						Following completion of a pre-licensure dental hygiene program and being licensed to practice dental hygiene, students must complete UW general education requirements as well as dental hygiene major requirements to obtain the BS degree. UW requirements include a 45-credit senior residency; English, writing, and quantitative reasoning proficiencies; and Areas of Knowledge courses. The dental hygiene major requirements include a sequence of three dental-hygiene core courses and a minimum of one path.
					

						Completion of the required major and UW requirements takes one to two years. Students planning to graduate in one year must have a faculty-approved plan of study within the first quarter of enrollment. Students planning a two-year program must have a faculty-approved plan of study within the first two quarters of enrollment. All students must meet with a program adviser yearly and are encouraged to meet with one quarterly.
					


						Core Requirement
					

						Students complete a year-long core requirement founded on significant oral health problems and probable solutions within the context of specific communities. Behavioral change, community development, health education models, and scientific literature provide a theoretical foundation for study in the core courses. The core curriculum focuses on real problems in real places. Using a people-places-problems approach, students use Internet and library resources to Research, analyze, discuss, and make evidence-based decisions relevant to oral health promotion and dental disease prevention. Further, they explore core values, ethics, laws, and issues related to care access, health promotion/disease prevention approaches, and healthcare delivery models. Included are field activities linked to education, government, business, and health resources. Additionally, dental hygiene majors complete requirements in at least one path and may take electives of their choice to complete the senior residency requirement. All students must complete the three core courses, D HYG 465, D HYG 492, and D HYG 493 (3 credits each, total 9) in the prescribed order.
					

						Path Requirement
					

						Students must select at least one of two pathways to fulfill the path requirement. The options are as follows:
					

Dental Hygiene Care. This path is for dental hygienists who desire to work as clinicians in hospitals, clinics, long-term care facilities, or other healthcare services that require advanced clinical and management skills. Students take courses in interdisciplinary health sciences, along with courses that focus on dental hygiene care and management of persons with physical, mental, developmental, and complex medical disabilities. Required courses in oral medicine augment this path. Major requirements include a minimum of 11 or 12 credits beyond the core: 10 credits in ORALM 460, or approved alternatives that focus on care of special clients; 3 credits of approved interdisciplinary health science courses; and 2 credits of approved Research.
					

Oral Health Promotion. This path is for dental hygienists who desire to work in multicultural and multidisciplinary settings at the local, state, national, or international levels and who require skills beyond clinical expertise. Students learn about the framework within which societies organize and manage their healthcare services and learn to link health with the environment, people's beliefs, ways of life, and kinship. They learn about differences between Western, Eastern and Shamanistic philosophies of health as prerequisites to developing educational strategies for oral health promotion and dental disease prevention. As students build skills essential for working with health agencies, they participate in community health projects as educators, advocates, or Researchers. Activities focus on the health of children and families in rural and remote areas of Washington state. Major requirements for this path include a minimum of 15 credits beyond the core, to include 3 credits in approved interdisciplinary health sciences courses, 3 credits in healthcare delivery systems, D HYG 402 or substitute; 3 credits in health promotion strategies (D HYG 403) or approved substitute; and a minimum of 4 credits in at least two sections of D HYG 404 or approved substitutes.
					

						Academic Standards
					

						Minimum 2.5 grade in each dental hygiene course counted toward satisfaction of graduation requirements. Minimum 2.00 cumulative GPA for all work done in residence at the University. A student whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.00 in any quarter is placed on academic probation.
					

						Student Outcomes and Opportunities
					


Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: The UW dental hygiene completion program emphasizes the health of populations rather than of individuals. Dental hygienists conduct community assessments; develop networks that engage community partners; set priorities; obtain baseline measures; set targets; and measure progress toward solutions to community oral health problems. Dental hygiene core skills include the ability to search and retrieve information from the Internet; use census, geographic, and demographic data; critically assess scientific literature; analyze and interpret data; and apply new scientific knowledge to solutions of health problems. In addition to the core knowledge set, dental hygienists select from two paths of study: care of special populations and oral health promotion. Depending upon area of interest, graduates pursue careers as business managers, marketing specialists, clinic administrators, hospital and nursing home dental hygienists, public health planners, program managers, Research assistants, and teachers of dental hygiene.
						

Honors Options Available: For Interdisciplinary Honors, see University Honors Program.
						

Research, Internships, and Service Learning:

								Students in the undergraduate program take off-campus service-learning courses related to their path of study. Generally, sites are located in rural and underserved health provider shortage areas of Washington state, but may include regional, national, or international locations.
							

								Students are eligible for international programs and exchanges following completion of their core course requirements. An applicant who is a dental hygienist from an affiliated international institution may be eligible for a tuition waiver during one or more quarters of the regular academic year (autumn, winter, spring). Students interested in these opportunities must contact the program's academic adviser at least six months in advance.
							

								Majors may be eligible, following the completion of prerequisite courses, to participate in study-abroad programs that focus on health care delivery, oral health promotion, or dental disease prevention. The University and its affiliated sites provide the settings for fieldwork, service, and Research activities, and interdisciplinary learning experiences.
							


Department Scholarships: Students may apply for scholarships offered by the Dental Hygiene Education fund.
						

Student Organizations/Associations: The Washington Rural Health Organization, Washington State Public Health Association, Washington State Dental Hygienists' Association, American Dental Education Association, and International Association of Dental Research are among many from which to select.

						Through their respective departments, the graduate faculty members of the School offer programs leading to the degrees of Master of Science in Dentistry, Master of Science, and Doctor of Philosophy, as well as postgraduate certificate programs.
					

						Master of Science in Dentistry/Postgraduate Certificates
					

						Fields of study for the MSD programs include endodontics, oral pathology, oral medicine and orofacial pain, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, periodontics, and prosthodontics. Although students may enroll in a graduate certificate program only, they may elect to pursue an MSD. Programs are planned to prepare students to think independently, to evaluate their own services and the literature of the programs, and to develop clinical skills to a level to permit successful clinical practice, teaching, or Research in their chosen specialty. Emphasis is placed on the basic principles of diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of the programs is not only to train students in their respective specialties but also to encourage preparation for academic careers or for Research. Research may be undertaken in basic or applied science. Opportunities for collaborative Research are available with the cooperation of other colleges, schools, or departments of the University.
					

						Postgraduate certificate programs are not administered by the Graduate School, and no thesis is required. The course content may vary somewhat from the MSD program, although the same academic standards are applied in both programs. Tuition and fees are assessed at the graduate level for both programs.

Professional Program


						Doctor of Dental Surgery
					

						The Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) curriculum provides students opportunities to learn the fundamental principles significant to the entire body of oral health. Students (approximately 63 per class) learn the basic health sciences, attain proficiency in clinical skills, develop an understanding of professional and ethical principles, and develop reasoning and critical decision-making skills that enable implementation of the dental knowledge base. The first year is divided among lecture, laboratory, and preclinical activities in basic sciences, dental anatomy, occlusion, and dental materials. There are also early clinical experiences in preventive dentistry and periodontics. In the second year, students develop additional preclinical skills, learn how basic science principles are applied to the clinical setting, and begin clinical patient treatment. In the third and fourth years, students primarily concentrate on providing clinical treatment and attend lectures that refine diagnostic and technical skills. Additionally, students are required to participate in elective clinical and didactic courses. Students choose elective courses offered by all departments, including opportunities in independent study, Research, seminars on various topics, and specialty clinical topics.
					

						The DDS curriculum extends for 42 months or 14 quarters, including two summer quarters. Twelve of the academic year quarters are ten weeks of instruction and one week of examination, while the two required summer quarters following years two and three are each nine weeks long. If needed, students may be allowed additional time to complete required coursework beyond 42 months.

A complete copy of the law is available from the School's Office of Student Life and Admissions and is forwarded upon request. Applications are not considered until completed disclosure forms have been returned to student admissions.
						


						The application is considered complete once all materials noted above (1-9) are returned. Upon receipt of the completed application, invitations for an interview are sent to applicants based on an additional screening of the whole file. The interview is an opportunity for an open, friendly discussion of the applicant's interests, background, and reasons for selecting dentistry as a profession. During the interview day, applicants have numerous opportunities to learn about UW programs, faculty, and student life.  In addition to the interview, the School provides the applicant with financial aid and cost information.  During the lunch hour, applicants meet with enrolled students and tour the School.  Applicants also meet with the deans to learn about programs, Research, and cultural opportunities.
					

						The admissions committee, composed of faculty and community dentists, determines admission status after considering the following:
					


Grades. Overall GPA and GPA in required predental science courses. Committee members look for a strong, consistent GPA without withdrawals, incompletes, repeated courses, or non-graded options. Grade trends are reviewed.
						

DAT (Dental Admission Test). The test, sponsored by the American Dental Association, covers several areas: reading comprehension, quantitative reasoning, survey of natural sciences (including biology, general, and organic chemistry), and perceptual ability (including form development, apertures, angles, cubes, and orthographic projections). At the UW, scores are reviewed to identify an applicant's areas of strength. The test must be taken no later than October 31, one year prior to admission.
						

Level of Pre-professional Education. The majority of applicants have completed a baccalaureate degree by the time of entry. Consideration is given to applicants who have not or do not expect to complete a baccalaureate degree, but who have completed all predental requirements, have a highly competitive academic record, and a minimum of three years' full-time coursework.
						

Dental Knowledge. Includes knowledge of the field of dentistry through volunteer experience in a dental setting (dentist's office, clinic, etc.), introductory dental coursework, and exploration of the dental literature. A qualified applicant has a clear understanding of the profession, a demonstrated interest in the field, and a minimum of 100 volunteer hours in a dental setting.
						

Contribution to Diversity. 
						

Unique Life Experiences. Among other things, Research and teaching efforts, travel, and work experience are some of the life experiences considered. 
						

Personal Attributes. In addition to motivation, the applicant's poise and communication skills are examined. Personal attributes such as integrity, responsibility, leadership, initiative, community service, perseverance, and diversity of interests are important.
						

Demonstrated Community Service.



						Interviews begin in October and typically end in February.  The American Dental Association Traffic Rules allow dental schools to begin making offers of acceptance on December 1.  The School uses a "rolling admission" format, so interviews and committee decisions continue to be made between December and March.  
					

						The Admissions Committee makes one of three decisions:
					


Offer of Acceptance. Admission application has been accepted. The applicant has a specified time to reply to reserve enrollment in the entering first-year class. In addition, enrollment is contingent on timely submission of the following: registration deposit, transcripts showing completion of all required predental courses, registration for autumn quarter of the upcoming academic year, and completion of required immunizations.
						

Alternate Status. Applicant is offered a position on the alternate list. The applicant has a specified time to reserve a position on this list, maintained until the beginning of the school year.
						

Denial of Admission. The Committee has considered the application but cannot offer a position or alternate status.
						


						Accepted applicants receive follow-up information about registration procedures, financial aid, and the orientation program throughout the spring and summer. Attendance at orientation is mandatory and provides an opportunity for newly enrolled students to learn about the upcoming curriculum, student rights and responsibilities, financial aid information, student organizations, challenge examinations, and the start of academic coursework. Orientation begins in late August. New students attend an off-campus student retreat to interact with peer advisers and meet classmates in an informal setting. 
					

Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE): The school participates in a program administered by WICHE for students who reside in western states not served by a dental school (Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Wyoming). Such students should seek requests for certification and information about benefits of the program from the WICHE commission office in their state of residence.

Student Outcomes and Opportunities

Learning Objectives:  The early childhood and family studies major immerses students in the study of child and family development and education.  Students learn about child development, early learning, and family studies from a variety of perspectives.  They receive a strong grounding in reading and understanding the theory and evidence that provide the foundation for the field and drive current research and policy efforts.
Expected Outcomes:  Students apply their knowledge and skill as they work alongside community-based teachers, community leaders, and care providers.  The degree provides excellent preparation for a wide variety of careers in early learning, childcare, parent and family support and education, child and community advocacy and organization, and social/mental health services.  It also serves as a pathway for graduate studies in education, child and family studies, educational policy, special education, and other areas.  This interdisciplinary major is offered at the sophomore, junior, and senior level.
Service Learning and Research:  Two sequences of field-based experiences provide students with real life-learning opportunities in community-based early childhood or family support/education settings.  Students participate in both an introductory seminar experience as well as a sequenced field experience during their first year in service learning. During the second phase, students participate in a three-quarter senior service learning, research, and senior project that provides advanced opportunities to integrate theory and practice in community-based early childhood or family support programs, and/or research settings. The seminar ties together research and practice, demonstrating how research informs evidence-based decision-making in programs and services. Students also receive guidance in career options and current events in the field, tying in major experiences with their own developmental and career goals. Learning objectives are outlined in class.
Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major).  See adviser for requirements.  
							Department Scholarships:  See departmental website for undergraduate scholarship information.

Washington State Certification is awarded by passing the Praxis Examination and by completing a 9-month internship of 1200 hours or more (half of which must be in a school setting); 6 credit hours of university case study supervision; 30 hours of internship credit. Students who successfully complete the internship may apply for National Certification as a school psychologist. 
						
Doctor of Education

							Prepares professionals whose primary interest is dealing directly with problems of educational practice. The EdD, as a professional degree, focuses on utilization of research and practitioners' knowledge, rather than on production of research knowledge.
						

							This degree requires specialized study with credit in education and related fields, sufficient preparation in research methodology to interpret research findings for use in practice, an internship and leadership training, a general examination, a dissertation on a problem of educational practice, and a final examination. In addition to the traditional professional degree, the College also offers another option for the Doctor of Education that requires a capstone experience (12 credits) rather than a dissertation. See details in NOTE, below.

							Degree Requirements
						

							102 credits, as follows:
						


Educational Specialization (24 credits):


										Area of specialization, designed to provide knowledge of the field (9 credits)
									

										General area or  special interests  within the area of specialization other than those selected to fulfill the 9 credits above (15 credits)
									


Related Field(s) (24 credits): Minimum 12 credits  from within education.  Credits outside education to complement educational specialization and to include multidisciplinary learning experiences

Leadership Training (9 credits): EDLPS 520, EDLPS 550, EDLPS 560
							

Supervised Internships and Field Experiences (9 credits): Internships and field experiences designed to work in education and related field(s), and to conduct field-based research and evaluation studies.
							

Dissertation (27 credits)



							NOTE: The Doctor of Education degree, offered through the leadership for learning program, focuses primarily on practical application rather than pure research and is a practice doctorate.  A dissertation is not required; 12 credit hours of capstone experience are required instead.  A corresponding increase in other areas (educational specialization, research preparation, etc.) is required in order to meet the 102-credit-hour requirement for the Doctor of Education. 
						

							Doctor of Philosophy
						

							A degree offering preparation for a research career on issues fundamental to education - issues that range from fairly narrow questions about human learning to macro-questions regarding the form of societies' educational institutions. The scope is broad. The degree may be organized around traditional study areas such as educational psychology, curriculum and instruction, special education, or educational leadership and policy. A student may develop a course of study that integrates various elements of more than one study area (e.g., multiethnic education and literacy). One study option is school psychology, which prepares students for the professional practice of psychology with school-age children, as well as for research.
						

							Admission Requirements
						


								Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores
							

								Master's degree or equivalent from an accredited institution
							

								Minimum GPA of 3.00 for the most recent 90 (60 semester) credits

							Degree Requirements
						

							Minimum 90 credits
						

							Six academic areas and the dissertation.  Although the department prescribes a limited number of required courses, it does require students to demonstrate in-depth knowledge of education and selected related fields. For most students, this means study in a broad area, a specialization within that area, two cognates, and a specialization outside the department.
						

							Degree requirements include a program of specialized study with credits both in education and in other academic units, preparation in research methodology adequate to design and assess research in the field of specialization, sufficient study in cognate fields inside and outside education to ensure that the candidate can place the specialized research in a broader context, a general examination, a research dissertation, and a final examination.

Student Outcomes and Opportunities

Learning Objectives:  The early childhood and family studies major immerses students in the study of child and family development and education.  Students learn about child development, early learning, and family studies from a variety of perspectives.  They receive a strong grounding in reading and understanding the theory and evidence that provide the foundation for the field and drive current research and policy efforts.
Expected Outcomes:  Students apply their knowledge and skill as they work alongside community-based teachers, community leaders, and care providers.  The degree provides excellent preparation for a wide variety of careers in early learning, childcare, parent and family support and education, child and community advocacy and organization, and social/mental health services.  It also serves as a pathway for graduate studies in education, child and family studies, educational policy, special education, and other areas.  This interdisciplinary major is offered at the sophomore, junior, and senior level.
Service Learning and Research:  Two sequences of field-based experiences provide students with real life-learning opportunities in community-based early childhood or family support/education settings.  Students participate in both an introductory seminar experience as well as a sequenced field experience during their first year in service learning. During the second phase, students participate in a three-quarter senior service learning, research, and senior project that provides advanced opportunities to integrate theory and practice in community-based early childhood or family support programs, and/or research settings. The seminar ties together research and practice, demonstrating how research informs evidence-based decision-making in programs and services. Students also receive guidance in career options and current events in the field, tying in major experiences with their own developmental and career goals. Learning objectives are outlined in class.
Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major).  See adviser for requirements.  
							Department Scholarships:  See departmental website for undergraduate scholarship information.

In the UW College of Education, only students studying school psychology can pursue the Educational Specialist degree.  The school psychology program prepares students to work with the social emotional needs of children and adolescents.  School psychologists frequently work in school settings providing assessment, intervention, and consultation services to students, teachers, or parents.  The three-year full-time program is comprised of two years of coursework and practicum and a third year 1200-hour internship.  The program, approved by National Association of School Psychologists (NASP), also meets the requirements for initial certification (Educational Staff Associate) as a school psychologist in the state of Washington.

Doctor of Education

							Prepares professionals whose primary interest is dealing directly with problems of educational practice. The EdD, as a professional degree, focuses on utilization of research and practitioners' knowledge, rather than on production of research knowledge.
						

							This degree requires specialized study with credit in education and related fields, sufficient preparation in research methodology to interpret research findings for use in practice, an internship and leadership training, a general examination, a dissertation on a problem of educational practice, and a final examination. In addition to the traditional professional degree, the College also offers another option for the Doctor of Education that requires a capstone experience (12 credits) rather than a dissertation. See details in NOTE, below.

Dissertation (27 credits)



							NOTE: The Doctor of Education degree, offered through the leadership for learning program, focuses primarily on practical application rather than pure research and is a practice doctorate.  A dissertation is not required; 12 credit hours of capstone experience are required instead.  A corresponding increase in other areas (educational specialization, research preparation, etc.) is required in order to meet the 102-credit-hour requirement for the Doctor of Education. 
						

							Doctor of Philosophy
						

							A degree offering preparation for a research career on issues fundamental to education - issues that range from fairly narrow questions about human learning to macro-questions regarding the form of societies' educational institutions. The scope is broad. The degree may be organized around traditional study areas such as educational psychology, curriculum and instruction, special education, or educational leadership and policy. A student may develop a course of study that integrates various elements of more than one study area (e.g., multiethnic education and literacy). One study option is school psychology, which prepares students for the professional practice of psychology with school-age children, as well as for research.
						

							Admission Requirements
						


								Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores

							Degree Requirements
						

							Minimum 90 credits
						

							Six academic areas and the dissertation.  Although the department prescribes a limited number of required courses, it does require students to demonstrate in-depth knowledge of education and selected related fields. For most students, this means study in a broad area, a specialization within that area, two cognates, and a specialization outside the department.
						

							Degree requirements include a program of specialized study with credits both in education and in other academic units, preparation in research methodology adequate to design and assess research in the field of specialization, sufficient study in cognate fields inside and outside education to ensure that the candidate can place the specialized research in a broader context, a general examination, a research dissertation, and a final examination.

Student Outcomes and Opportunities

Learning Objectives:  The early childhood and family studies major immerses students in the study of child and family development and education.  Students learn about child development, early learning, and family studies from a variety of perspectives.  They receive a strong grounding in reading and understanding the theory and evidence that provide the foundation for the field and drive current research and policy efforts.
Expected Outcomes:  Students apply their knowledge and skill as they work alongside community-based teachers, community leaders, and care providers.  The degree provides excellent preparation for a wide variety of careers in early learning, childcare, parent and family support and education, child and community advocacy and organization, and social/mental health services.  It also serves as a pathway for graduate studies in education, child and family studies, educational policy, special education, and other areas.  This interdisciplinary major is offered at the sophomore, junior, and senior level.
Service Learning and Research:  Two sequences of field-based experiences provide students with real life-learning opportunities in community-based early childhood or family support/education settings.  Students participate in both an introductory seminar experience as well as a sequenced field experience during their first year in service learning. During the second phase, students participate in a three-quarter senior service learning, research, and senior project that provides advanced opportunities to integrate theory and practice in community-based early childhood or family support programs, and/or research settings. The seminar ties together research and practice, demonstrating how research informs evidence-based decision-making in programs and services. Students also receive guidance in career options and current events in the field, tying in major experiences with their own developmental and career goals. Learning objectives are outlined in class.
Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major).  See adviser for requirements.  
							Department Scholarships:  See departmental website for undergraduate scholarship information.

						Engineering is the science and art of applying scientific and mathematical principles, experience, judgment, and common sense to design devices and systems that benefit society. Engineers are fascinated by questions of how and why things work. They use their training in mathematics, physics, and chemistry to understand the physical world and develop creative solutions to society's complex needs. Engineers may be designers, planners, managers, analysts, researchers, consultants, sales specialists, and more. Engineering graduates have many career possibilities open to them.
					

						The primary goal of College of Engineering educational programs is to prepare students for a professional career in engineering by providing the technical foundation required for success in industry, government, or academia. Other goals of the College are to instill within its students the highest ethical standards, the capability for lifelong learning, and a curiosity about the world. Excellence in undergraduate and graduate academic programs remains the College's highest priority.
					

						For undergraduates, the College of Engineering offers a flexible curriculum that not only accommodates varied student needs, both in established departmental programs and interdisciplinary studies, but also culminates in a major and meaningful design experience. (See Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies Program for interdisciplinary undergraduate programs.)
					

						For graduate students, the College of Engineering offers master's and doctoral programs in aeronautics and astronautics, bioengineering, chemical, civil and environmental, computer, electrical, human centered design and engineering, industrial and systems engineering, materials science, and mechanical engineering.
					

						The College offers active educational and research programs, both departmental and interdisciplinary, at the graduate levels. (See Interengineering Graduate Program for interdisciplinary graduate programs.)
					

						The College of Engineering has been a major unit of the University since 1899. The first engineering degrees were authorized in mining engineering and metallurgical engineering in 1898. Degrees were added for civil engineering (1901), electrical engineering (1902), mechanical engineering (1906), chemical engineering (1907), ceramic engineering (1919), aeronautical engineering (1929), bioengineering (1983), industrial engineering (1986), and computer engineering (1987). A degree program in technical communication was implemented in 1989.   The new human centered design and engineering degree title replaced technical communication in 2009. In 2011, 2,229 upper-division undergraduate majors and 1,787 graduate students were enrolled in engineering programs taught by a faculty of 228 tenure track and 184 other engineering faculty members.
					

						College Facilities
					

						Teaching and research activities of the College are conducted in fourteen major campus buildings (and portions of others), which contain the College's offices, classrooms, and research and teaching laboratories. The Engineering Library, a branch of the University Libraries, provides outstanding collections of books, periodicals, technical reports, and patents of interest to engineers. Computers and terminals are available in all departments and through the Student Access and Computing Group (SACG).
					

						Student Organizations and Activities

						The Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies (IES) Program is intended for students whose desired course of study does not fall within one of the traditional engineering departments. An interdisciplinary program combines coursework from at least one engineering department as well as other department(s) on campus (engineering or other) to allow students to create a program of study not available through the existing undergraduate degree programs. Although coursework may involve departments outside the College of Engineering, the major thrust must be in engineering.
					

						Undergraduate Programs
					

						Bachelor of Science in Engineering and Bachelor of Science
					

						The IES Program offers a nonprofessional degree program leading to the Bachelor of Science (BS) and a professional degree program for the Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE).
					

						Due to the uniqueness of each interdisciplinary student's program of studies, the BS and BSE degrees are not accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. The experience requirement to obtain a professional engineering license is two years longer for a BSE graduate, except in surveying, than for a graduate of an accredited program. A BS graduate is not eligible for a professional engineering license.
					

						Interdisciplinary students develop personal programs of study approved by a faculty adviser with similar interests. Contact Student Academic Services, email: engradv@uw.edu or phone: (206) 543-1770, for information on established procedures and applications for entry into the BSE and BS programs. Entrance requirements and the continuation policy for participation in these programs are consistent with those of other departments in the College.
					

						Bachelor of Science in Engineering
					

						Admission to this program (usually after completion of 90 credits) is competitive with a minimum 2.80 GPA in technical courses required for entry. A minimum of 75 credits must be completed after entering the program before a BSE degree is awarded. Detailed information regarding the BSE degree can be obtained from an adviser in Student Academic Services (301 Loew).
					

						Bachelor of Science
					

						The nonprofessional Bachelor of Science degree provides greater flexibility than does the Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree. It can be an excellent base for subsequent professional studies in law, medicine, or business. It may also be the primary educational objective in such fields as technical writing, engineering sales, or environmental studies. Detailed requirements are available from the adviser in Student Academic Services (301 Loew).

						Honors Program
					

							The University Honors Program provides a special learning context for high-achieving students looking for a rigorous and enhanced educational experience. All departments in the College of Engineering participate in the UW Honors Program. 
						

							There are two types of Honors degrees available within the College of Engineering: College Honors and Departmental Honors. Students in either program are part of the University Honors Program.
						
							College Honors
						

								To be eligible for College Honors, students must be accepted to the University Honors Program in their freshman year. Additionally, students must be accepted into the departmental honors program (see information below on Departmental Honors) for their major, which usually occurs during the junior year.  Students who complete both the Honors Core Curriculum (see the University Honors Program for more information) and the departmental honors requirements graduate "With College Honors in Name of Major". 
							

							Departmental Honors
						

								Students who do not participate in or complete the Honors Core Curriculum but are admitted into and complete departmental honors requirements receive a degree "With Honors in Name of Major".
							

Admission Requirements: All engineering departments require students to have at least a 3.30 cumulative UW GPA to be eligible for departmental honors. Also, most departments require students to complete a specified number of departmental courses with a minimum departmental GPA. 
							

								Departmental honors requirements vary by major and are established by the individual departments.  Most departments in the College of Engineering require 9 to 10 credits of Honors courses in the major and an Honors senior project or thesis.
							

						International Study
					

						Given the increased likelihood that engineering students will have overseas work experiences or do business with international clients and competitors, the College encourages students to study foreign languages in addition to their engineering coursework and to take advantage of opportunities for study at foreign universities either at the undergraduate or graduate level. The College has exchange agreements with approximately thirty universities in seventeen countries. Foreign-language courses at the third-quarter level or above (e.g., GERMAN 103) may be applied toward the VLPA general education requirement. For more information about international study, visit the College of Engineering International Studies website at www.engr.washington.edu/curr_students/international.html. Engineering students can also participate in the Global Engineering Education Exchange program (through the Center for Workforce Development, located in 101 Wilson Annex) for opportunities to study abroad. Through the UW Chapter of Engineers Without Borders (EWB)  students.washington.edu/ewbuw, students work with disadvantaged communities worldwide in order to improve their quality of life through the implementation of environmentally sustainable, equitable, and economical engineering projects.
					

						Admission
					

						Students follow one of three pathways to gain admission:
					


Direct-to-College: Freshman applicants indicate an engineering major as their first-choice on the University application.  Students admitted through this pathway enter the UW with Engineering Undeclared status and usually place into an engineering major after completing freshman-level requirements.  A majority of engineering students enter majors through this pathway.
						

Transfer Students: Apply to the UW by the published deadline.  Submit an application to an engineering major.  Quarters of admission vary by department.  Admission is capacity constrained.  See department websites for course requirements. 
						

Other Enrolled UW Students: Those not admitted through the Direct-to-College pathway may also apply for admission to engineering majors. Admission though this pathway is limited and is capacity constrained. See department websites for course requirements. 
						


						Direct-to College Admission
					

						Freshman admitted to the UW who indicate an engineering major as their preferred choice enter the UW with Engineering Undeclared status and must complete requirements prior to requesting placement into a specific engineering major. This is the standard admission pathway for engineering students entering the UW as freshmen.  Admission to an engineering major occurs twice a year; application deadlines are July 1 for autumn quarter and January 15 for spring quarter.
					

						Students submit a ranked list of majors along with supporting materials.  Since some majors are not able to take all students who request admission, students must identify alternative majors to ensure placement.   
					

						Capacity-constrained departments review studentsâ academic records and supporting materials to determine priority for admission.  Department priority and student department ranking are both used to determine final placement.     
					

						Engineering Undeclared Placement Requirements
					

						Engineering Undeclared students may request placement into an engineering major after completion of minimum requirements specified by the department.  Placement requirements for all majors include the following:   
					


							MATH 124, MATH 125, MATH 126
						

							English composition
						

							Minimum three science, programming, and/or advanced mathematics courses.  While requirements vary, most engineering majors require three or more courses from CHEM 142, CHEM 152, CHEM 162, PHYS 121, PHYS 122, and PHYS 123.  Computer Engineering also includes CSE 142 and CSE 143.  Human Centered Design and Engineering also includes a statistics course.  See department websites for details.
						

							Minimum 2.0 grade in MATH 126 and in the course used to satisfy the English composition requirement.
						

							Minimum 12 credits as a matriculated UW student.  Some departments require more credits.  See department websites for details.
						

							Minimum 2.50 GPA in prerequisite courses.  Prerequisite GPA is determined from required mathematics, science, programming, and English composition courses.
						


						Continuation Policy for Engineering Undeclared Students
					

						While the University has general regulations governing scholastic eligibility for continuation, the College of Engineering and the engineering departments have additional requirements in order to make the best use of limited facilities and resources.  Criteria and procedures applied to Engineering Undeclared students for continuation in the College include:
					


							Complete at least one required mathematics, science, computer programming, or engineering course each quarter.
						

							Maintain minimum 2.50 GPA in mathematics, science, English composition, computer programming, and engineering courses.
						

							Normally declare into a major after completion of three or four quarters at the UW.  Students unable to place into a major after completion of six quarters are dropped from Engineering Undeclared status.
						


						Review and Notification of Progress
					

						Student progress is reviewed each quarter.  Students whose performance fails to meet the standards outlined above receive a warning letter recommending they meet with an engineering adviser.  Students on warning status who fail to meet satisfactory progress requirements after one quarter are placed on probation; a hold is placed on their registration, and they must meet with a College of Engineering adviser. Students on probation who fail to meet satisfactory progress requirements after one quarter are dropped from Engineering Undeclared status.  Such students may appeal for continuation as Engineering Undeclared students by writing the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, the letter to describe any extenuating circumstances and to include any additional relevant information.  
					

						Types of Programs
					

						The College offers three basic programs leading to Bachelor of Science degrees:
					

Departmental Major: This program leads to a Bachelor of Science degree in a designated field of engineering (e.g., Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering). It is designed for students who intend to practice as professional engineers in a standard branch of engineering or who plan to undertake graduate study in that field. The curricula for these degrees are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202-4012, telephone: (410) 347-7700. Accreditation requirements stipulate certain course-distribution requirements for the undergraduate degree. A description of how each of the accredited baccalaureate programs meets the ABET requirements is available from the department office and from the College office. Accredited four-year curricula leading to baccalaureate degrees are offered in aeronautics and astronautics, bioengineering, chemical, civil and environmental, computer, electrical, industrial and systems, mechanical, materials science and engineering, and bioresource science and engineering (formerly paper science and engineering). (The bioresource science and engineering major is offered in the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences and is a joint program with the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences and the College of Engineering.)
					

						The following programs in the College of Engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET:
					


							Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering
						

							Bioengineering
						

							Chemical Engineering
						

							Civil and Environmental Engineering
						

							Computer Engineering
						

							Electrical Engineering
						

							Industrial and Systems Engineering
						

							Materials Science and Engineering
						

							Mechanical Engineering
						


						A curriculum leading to a baccalaureate degree is also offered by Human Centered Design and Engineering.
					

						Application to a department or program at the upper-division level is made at the time lower-division requirements are satisfied. Currently enrollment limits imposed by faculty size and available laboratory/classroom space are such that entry into a specific department or program is usually competitive. In general, a student applicant must demonstrate scholastic aptitude, as evidenced by the attainment of grades averaging a minimum 2.50 or above (depending upon the program) in mathematics, the natural sciences, English composition, and other courses. A 2.50 GPA is a minimum only. In reality, the GPA of those offered admission is higher. The student is urged to plan ahead by learning the intended department or program requirements and particularly noting which requirements must be fulfilled by the time application is made.
					

Non-departmental Professional Program: This program leads to a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree and is designed for students who have well defined, special educational objectives that departmental programs do not satisfy. Graduates can practice as professional engineers in newly developing fields, or they may embark on graduate study in these or allied fields (see Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies Program).
					

Nonprofessional Program: Leading to a Bachelor of Science degree, this program is intended for students who wish to have significant exposure to science and engineering courses, but do not plan to engage in professional engineering practice (see Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies Program).
					

						Graduation Requirements
					

						To graduate, students must meet or exceed the requirements of the University and their particular program or department. All program or departmental requirements are given in the specific section that describes that program or department.
					

						All departments of the College have continuation policies that specify a minimum rate of progress as well as minimum academic-performance levels. These policies may be more restrictive than those generally applied by the University and may change with time. Information on current policy is available at the departmental offices.
					

						Selecting courses that fulfill graduation requirements is the responsibility of each student. Students are urged to check carefully the course and credit requirements of the program in which they are enrolled.
					



Inter-engineering Graduate Programs


						Master of Science in Engineering and Master of Science
					

						The College offers graduate programs leading to the Master of Science in Engineering and Master of Science degrees, without designation of a specific major. For graduate degrees within specific majors, see the individual departmental listings.
					

						The civil, mechanical, and chemical departments, and inter-engineering offer approved programs that lead to the Master of Science in Engineering degree. The civil department, inter-engineering, and the materials science and engineering department offer approved programs that lead to the Master of Science degree. 
					

						The Inter-engineering Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) and Master of Science (MS) program is intended for students whose desired course of study does not fall within one of the traditional engineering graduate programs. An inter-engineering program combines coursework from at least one graduate engineering department as well as other graduate department(s) on campus (engineering or other) to allow students to create a program of study not available through existing graduate degree programs. Applications and files of students entering the MS or MSE option are handled by the designated engineering department. Admission requires a statement describing the applicant's objectives. This statement should state why the student wants to enter the MS/MSE program rather than one of the traditional engineering graduate programs. Applicants to the MS/MSE program must have well-defined educational objectives which cannot be satisfied by established engineering programs.
					
Admission Requirements

						MSE/MS applicants must have a bachelor's degree in engineering, mathematics, or science with a minimum 3.00 GPA in courses taken in the junior and senior years. Students entering without an accredited engineering undergraduate degree and seeking an MSE degree satisfy the minimum general requirements of the College of Engineering baccalaureate degree. Students complete the degree within two years; situations requiring longer must be approved by the student's faculty adviser.
					

Development of the Plan of Study: Before applying, the student consults a faculty member from each department in which the student intends to work, and identifies one to serve as the faculty adviser. Each student develops a plan of study and research that meets the general degree requirements (below) and satisfies the student's own program objectives. The program must include in-depth coursework from two or more departments and be approved by the faculty adviser(s). The proposed program becomes part of the student's application to the inter-engineering MSE/MS program. 
					

Development of the Statement of Objectives: Students submit a one-page statement of study and career objectives for seeking this degree, explaining why the student wants to enter the MSE/MS program rather than a traditional engineering graduate program. Also, students should include any additional information, such as work experience, outside interests, and unusual circumstances, that may contribute to a better understanding of the student's record.  
					
Degree Requirements

						48 credits
					

						Minimum 39 credits of coursework, with no more than 9 credits of engineering courses at the 400 level and at least 21 credits of engineering courses at the 500 level; also, at least 9 credits of thesis study/preparation.

						Engineering is the science and art of applying scientific and mathematical principles, experience, judgment, and common sense to design devices and systems that benefit society. Engineers are fascinated by questions of how and why things work. They use their training in mathematics, physics, and chemistry to understand the physical world and develop creative solutions to society's complex needs. Engineers may be designers, planners, managers, analysts, researchers, consultants, sales specialists, and more. Engineering graduates have many career possibilities open to them.
					

						The primary goal of College of Engineering educational programs is to prepare students for a professional career in engineering by providing the technical foundation required for success in industry, government, or academia. Other goals of the College are to instill within its students the highest ethical standards, the capability for lifelong learning, and a curiosity about the world. Excellence in undergraduate and graduate academic programs remains the College's highest priority.
					

						For undergraduates, the College of Engineering offers a flexible curriculum that not only accommodates varied student needs, both in established departmental programs and interdisciplinary studies, but also culminates in a major and meaningful design experience. (See Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies Program for interdisciplinary undergraduate programs.)
					

						For graduate students, the College of Engineering offers master's and doctoral programs in aeronautics and astronautics, bioengineering, chemical, civil and environmental, computer, electrical, human centered design and engineering, industrial and systems engineering, materials science, and mechanical engineering.
					

						The College offers active educational and research programs, both departmental and interdisciplinary, at the graduate levels. (See Interengineering Graduate Program for interdisciplinary graduate programs.)
					

						The College of Engineering has been a major unit of the University since 1899. The first engineering degrees were authorized in mining engineering and metallurgical engineering in 1898. Degrees were added for civil engineering (1901), electrical engineering (1902), mechanical engineering (1906), chemical engineering (1907), ceramic engineering (1919), aeronautical engineering (1929), bioengineering (1983), industrial engineering (1986), and computer engineering (1987). A degree program in technical communication was implemented in 1989.   The new human centered design and engineering degree title replaced technical communication in 2009. In 2011, 2,229 upper-division undergraduate majors and 1,787 graduate students were enrolled in engineering programs taught by a faculty of 228 tenure track and 184 other engineering faculty members.
					

						College Facilities
					

						Teaching and research activities of the College are conducted in fourteen major campus buildings (and portions of others), which contain the College's offices, classrooms, and research and teaching laboratories. The Engineering Library, a branch of the University Libraries, provides outstanding collections of books, periodicals, technical reports, and patents of interest to engineers. Computers and terminals are available in all departments and through the Student Access and Computing Group (SACG).
					

						Student Organizations and Activities
					

						All major professional engineering societies have student chapters on campus, and all engineering students are encouraged to join the chapter that represents their field of interest. The UW Chapter of Engineers Without Borders (EWB) students.washington.edu/ewbuw is a registered student-run organization of the University of Washington with members from many engineering as well as non-engineering backgrounds.
					

						The College also has student chapters of the Society of Women Engineers, American Indian Science and Engineering Society, National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and the Phi Sigma Rho engineering sorority. Students are encouraged to join the University-wide Science and Engineering Business Association (SEBA).
					

						The honor society open to engineering students is Tau Beta Pi.
					

						Students serve with faculty members on engineering policy committees which make recommendations concerning instructor evaluation, curriculum revisions, advising, grading systems, and other matters of interest to students and faculty.
					



						Special Programs and Resources
					


							Engineering Co-op and Internship Program 
						
						 014 Loew, Box 352180
engrcoop@uw.edu

						The Engineering Co-op and iIternship Program provides an opportunity for pre-engineering and engineering students to combine practical, full-time, on-the-job engineering experience with academic study before graduation. Students typically work full-time for three months or more and then return to full-time academic status upon completion of the co-op assignment. Some students work part-time while continuing coursework. In addition, students receive academic credit for the co-op experience. In several engineering departments, the credit earned can be applied toward degree requirements in the major. Advantages of participation include:  assistance in deciding which field of engineering to follow, early experience in the industrial sector and industrial exposure that can help guide a student's remaining studies; additional income to help defray college expenses, relevance and motivation for study based on real engineering work, and work experience and employment contacts that may result in regular employment after graduation. 
					

						Information may be obtained from the Engineering Co-op and Internship Program office, College of Engineering, Box 352180 (014 Loew), or by visiting the Engineering Co-op and Internship program website.

Admission to an engineering major occurs twice a year; application deadlines are July 1 for autumn quarter and January 15 for spring quarter.
					

						Students submit a ranked list of majors along with supporting materials.  Since some majors are not able to take all students who request admission, students must identify alternative majors to ensure placement.   
					

						Capacity-constrained departments review studentsâ academic records and supporting materials to determine priority for admission.  Department priority and student department ranking are both used to determine final placement.     
					

						Engineering Undeclared Placement Requirements
					

						Engineering Undeclared students may request placement into an engineering major after completion of minimum requirements specified by the department.  Placement requirements for all majors include the following:   
					


							MATH 124, MATH 125, MATH 126
						

							English composition
						

							Minimum three science, programming, and/or advanced mathematics courses.  While requirements vary, most engineering majors require three or more courses from CHEM 142, CHEM 152, CHEM 162, PHYS 121, PHYS 122, and PHYS 123.  Computer Engineering also includes CSE 142 and CSE 143.  Human Centered Design and Engineering also includes a statistics course.  See department websites for details.
						

							Minimum 2.0 grade in MATH 126 and in the course used to satisfy the English composition requirement.
						

							Minimum 12 credits as a matriculated UW student.  Some departments require more credits.  See department websites for details.
						

							Minimum 2.50 GPA in prerequisite courses.  Prerequisite GPA is determined from required mathematics, science, programming, and English composition courses.
						


						Continuation Policy for Engineering Undeclared Students
					

						While the University has general regulations governing scholastic eligibility for continuation, the College of Engineering and the engineering departments have additional requirements in order to make the best use of limited facilities and resources.  Criteria and procedures applied to Engineering Undeclared students for continuation in the College include:
					


							Complete at least one required mathematics, science, computer programming, or engineering course each quarter.
						

							Maintain minimum 2.50 GPA in mathematics, science, English composition, computer programming, and engineering courses.
						

							Normally declare into a major after completion of three or four quarters at the UW.  Students unable to place into a major after completion of six quarters are dropped from Engineering Undeclared status.
						


						Review and Notification of Progress
					

						Student progress is reviewed each quarter.  Students whose performance fails to meet the standards outlined above receive a warning letter recommending they meet with an engineering adviser.  Students on warning status who fail to meet satisfactory progress requirements after one quarter are placed on probation; a hold is placed on their registration, and they must meet with a College of Engineering adviser. Students on probation who fail to meet satisfactory progress requirements after one quarter are dropped from Engineering Undeclared status.  Such students may appeal for continuation as Engineering Undeclared students by writing the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, the letter to describe any extenuating circumstances and to include any additional relevant information.  
					

						Types of Programs
					

						The College offers three basic programs leading to Bachelor of Science degrees:
					

Departmental Major: This program leads to a Bachelor of Science degree in a designated field of engineering (e.g., Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering). It is designed for students who intend to practice as professional engineers in a standard branch of engineering or who plan to undertake graduate study in that field. The curricula for these degrees are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202-4012, telephone: (410) 347-7700. Accreditation requirements stipulate certain course-distribution requirements for the undergraduate degree. A description of how each of the accredited baccalaureate programs meets the ABET requirements is available from the department office and from the College office. Accredited four-year curricula leading to baccalaureate degrees are offered in aeronautics and astronautics, bioengineering, chemical, civil and environmental, computer, electrical, industrial and systems, mechanical, materials science and engineering, and bioresource science and engineering (formerly paper science and engineering). (The bioresource science and engineering major is offered in the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences and is a joint program with the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences and the College of Engineering.)
					

						The following programs in the College of Engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET:
					


							Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering
						

							Bioengineering
						

							Chemical Engineering
						

							Civil and Environmental Engineering
						

							Computer Engineering
						

							Electrical Engineering
						

							Industrial and Systems Engineering
						

							Materials Science and Engineering
						

							Mechanical Engineering
						


						A curriculum leading to a baccalaureate degree is also offered by Human Centered Design and Engineering.
					

						Application to a department or program at the upper-division level is made at the time lower-division requirements are satisfied. Currently enrollment limits imposed by faculty size and available laboratory/classroom space are such that entry into a specific department or program is usually competitive. In general, a student applicant must demonstrate scholastic aptitude, as evidenced by the attainment of grades averaging a minimum 2.50 or above (depending upon the program) in mathematics, the natural sciences, English composition, and other courses. A 2.50 GPA is a minimum only. In reality, the GPA of those offered admission is higher. The student is urged to plan ahead by learning the intended department or program requirements and particularly noting which requirements must be fulfilled by the time application is made.
					

Non-departmental Professional Program: This program leads to a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree and is designed for students who have well defined, special educational objectives that departmental programs do not satisfy. Graduates can practice as professional engineers in newly developing fields, or they may embark on graduate study in these or allied fields (see Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies Program).
					

Nonprofessional Program: Leading to a Bachelor of Science degree, this program is intended for students who wish to have significant exposure to science and engineering courses, but do not plan to engage in professional engineering practice (see Interdisciplinary Engineering Studies Program).
					

						Graduation Requirements
					

						To graduate, students must meet or exceed the requirements of the University and their particular program or department. All program or departmental requirements are given in the specific section that describes that program or department.
					

						All departments of the College have continuation policies that specify a minimum rate of progress as well as minimum academic-performance levels. These policies may be more restrictive than those generally applied by the University and may change with time. Information on current policy is available at the departmental offices.
					

						Selecting courses that fulfill graduation requirements is the responsibility of each student. Students are urged to check carefully the course and credit requirements of the program in which they are enrolled.
					



Inter-engineering Graduate Programs


						Master of Science in Engineering and Master of Science
					

						The College offers graduate programs leading to the Master of Science in Engineering and Master of Science degrees, without designation of a specific major. For graduate degrees within specific majors, see the individual departmental listings.
					

						The civil, mechanical, and chemical departments, and inter-engineering offer approved programs that lead to the Master of Science in Engineering degree. The civil department, inter-engineering, and the materials science and engineering department offer approved programs that lead to the Master of Science degree. 
					

						The Inter-engineering Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) and Master of Science (MS) program is intended for students whose desired course of study does not fall within one of the traditional engineering graduate programs. An inter-engineering program combines coursework from at least one graduate engineering department as well as other graduate department(s) on campus (engineering or other) to allow students to create a program of study not available through existing graduate degree programs. Applications and files of students entering the MS or MSE option are handled by the designated engineering department. Admission requires a statement describing the applicant's objectives. This statement should state why the student wants to enter the MS/MSE program rather than one of the traditional engineering graduate programs. Applicants to the MS/MSE program must have well-defined educational objectives which cannot be satisfied by established engineering programs.
					
Admission Requirements

						MSE/MS applicants must have a bachelor's degree in engineering, mathematics, or science with a minimum 3.00 GPA in courses taken in the junior and senior years. Students entering without an accredited engineering undergraduate degree and seeking an MSE degree satisfy the minimum general requirements of the College of Engineering baccalaureate degree. Students complete the degree within two years; situations requiring longer must be approved by the student's faculty adviser.
					

Development of the Plan of Study: Before applying, the student consults a faculty member from each department in which the student intends to work, and identifies one to serve as the faculty adviser. Each student develops a plan of study and research that meets the general degree requirements (below) and satisfies the student's own program objectives. The program must include in-depth coursework from two or more departments and be approved by the faculty adviser(s). The proposed program becomes part of the student's application to the inter-engineering MSE/MS program. 
					

Development of the Statement of Objectives: Students submit a one-page statement of study and career objectives for seeking this degree, explaining why the student wants to enter the MSE/MS program rather than a traditional engineering graduate program. Also, students should include any additional information, such as work experience, outside interests, and unusual circumstances, that may contribute to a better understanding of the student's record.  
					
Degree Requirements

						48 credits
					

						Minimum 39 credits of coursework, with no more than 9 credits of engineering courses at the 400 level and at least 21 credits of engineering courses at the 500 level; also, at least 9 credits of thesis study/preparation.

Department Overview

						105 Benson
					

						The chemical engineering profession is a close-knit group with a common background in chemical processes, systems analysis, and systems economics. Chemical engineering training occurs through course and laboratory work addressing mathematical, scientific, and engineering fundamentals. With a strong background in mathematics, chemistry, and physics, chemical engineering students study transport phenomena (the description of momentum, heat, and mass transfer in chemical processes); chemical kinetics and reaction engineering; process control and design; and optimization of chemical processes. These subjects are common throughout the traditional chemical industry, applying as well to other industries such as electronics manufacture and biological and biochemical engineering. Chemical engineers find industrial employment in areas of electronics, petroleum, consulting, chemical, automotive, forest products, biotechnology, and energy. Chemical engineers also find careers in academia and government and military service.

Civil and Environmental Engineering



Overview
Undergraduate
Graduate




Department Overview

						201 More
					

						Civil and environmental engineering is a profession which interfaces closely with society in the planning, design, construction, and management of facilities serving the needs of people. These activities focus on: transportation infrastructure and construction; heavy construction; hydrology and hydrodynamics; structures, mechanics, and geotechnical engineering; drinking water and wastewater treatment, and water quality management ; solid- and hazardous-waste disposal; and air quality management. 
					

						A civil engineer may specialize in one or several of these activities and may further specialize in a particular function, such as design or management. The work frequently provides close associations with the legal profession, urban and regional planners, economists, public officials, biologists, chemists, financial consultants, architects, and system analysts. Education and practice require a consideration not only of the technological-science aspects of a particular problem but also of its relationship to social, economic, political, and environmental constraints. Civil and environmental engineers create and maintain infrastructure in a heavily human-influenced ecosystem.
					

						To accommodate these wide interests, the department is organized into six academic areas: construction engineering; transportation engineering; geotechnical engineering; structural engineering and mechanics; environmental engineering; and hydrology and hydrodynamics.

Department Overview

						AC101 Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science and Engineering
					

						UW Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) educates students to become leaders in the design and implementation of the computing systems that touch every aspect of modern society. CSE is widely recognized as one of the top programs in the world, with passionate faculty bringing the latest advances into the classroom and the lab.
					

						CSE offers two undergraduate degrees: Computer Science (through the College of Arts & Sciences) and Computer Engineering (through the College of Engineering). While the degree requirements differ in some details, undergraduate majors working toward either degree have the same broad opportunities to take the wide array of courses that CSE offers. Many of our graduates go on to careers at the world's great technology companies, from the largest industry titans to the smallest start-ups. Others join innovative companies and non-profit organizations outside the traditional computing industry to use software, hardware, and data to solve the world's greatest challenges. Still others go on to challenging graduate programs in a variety of fields.
						
					

						At the graduate level, CSE offers (1) an integrated Master's program for some of our undergraduate majors seeking a deeper education before leaving campus, (2) an evening Master's program for currently employed software professionals, and (3) a PhD program for students seeking a research career.
					

						The field of computing is broad and growing, and CSE's course catalog reflects this breadth. Beyond the popular introductory programming courses taken by thousands of students from every major on campus, our courses cover everything from the mathematical foundations of what computers can and cannot do; to hands-on experiences building software and hardware artifacts with a range of programming languages and tools; to advanced courses in software engineering, human-computer interaction, computer graphics and animation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, large-scale data management, natural language processing, computer networking, computational biology, robotics, computer security and privacy, and much more.
					

						Computers are the most flexible and powerful machines ever created. While the applications of computing continue to grow and change, the core magic of CSE is timeless: computer scientists and engineers combine creative problem-solving, rigorous design, and the creation of algorithms, software, and hardware systems to build solutions that change the world.

						The Department of Computer Science and Engineering offers the following programs of study:
					


							The Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering degree
						

							The Bachelor of Science degree with a major in computer science (see Computer Science in the Arts and Sciences section of this catalog)
						

							Minor in Neural Computation and Engineering
						


						The core requirements of the two undergraduate majors are similar. The computer engineering major includes a general foundation in engineering fundamentals to enable interdisciplinary work with other departments in the College of Engineering and the University as a whole.  It may be more appropriate for students who are interested in building systems that include both hardware and software components and that must be engineered to meet a variety of cost and performance constraints.
					

						The computer science major may be more appropriate for students who want to earn a double major with another College of Arts and Sciences program, who want the additional flexibility of the computer science requirements (the computer engineering major has more required courses and fewer electives), or who may be more interested in the design of software systems and applications.

HCDE graduates obtain jobs, primarily in the high-tech industry (e.g., Microsoft, Intel, Amazon, Facebook, T-Mobile, Google, Boeing), researching and designing user interfaces, websites, and other form factors to improve the user experience. 
					

					HCDE emphasizes student-centered, hands-on learning. Beyond taking traditional classroom courses, students join research groups and work side-by-side with top-ranked professors and graduate students to enhance the knowledge base of this dynamic field. The educational mission is supported by up-to-date facilities. 
					

					HCDE prepares students to assume positions of intellectual leadership in industry, government, non-profit organizations, and academia, HCDE students learn the research skills appropriate to their interests, the most effective design strategies, and the most current technologies and practices. They also learn enduring theory and principles so they can dynamically respond to the evolving field of human centered design and engineering.
					

					Technical communicators use their language, visual, and analytical skills, as well as training and research in electronic and other media, to create and enhance communication in scientific and technical environments. Human centered design and engineering prepares students to design, create, edit, and evaluate technical and scientific discourse. The department provides coursework in the development of online help systems and in the design of general-audience content for delivery by means of advanced communication technologies such as the web. 
					

					The complexities of modern life have greatly increased the number of people who need to communicate about technical and other specialized topics. Scientific journal articles, manuals, proposals, and other genres are important for a vast array of readers. With the Information Age, gaining and sharing technological understanding and capability has become a crucial human activity. People communicate in more genres, address broader (often global) audiences, and face more complex rhetorical problems than ever before. 
					

					To achieve success in their communication activities, progressive organizations are employing sophisticated planning and development methods, including user-centered design and evaluation, content management, and systems-based analyses. In addition, they undertake research projects and apply existing research to their own needs. Contemporary research in technical communication ranges from controlled empirical research on the processing of text, graphics, and multimedia content to observational research on how meaning is created and negotiated in business environments and virtual communities. 
					

					Other major interests include the human-computer interface, hypermedia, communications technology, rhetoric of technical discourse, international communication, visual communication, publications and communications management, policy analysis of technological systems, and research and testing.

Materials Science and Engineering



Overview
Undergraduate
Graduate




Department Overview

								302 Roberts
							

								Materials science and engineering is an interdisciplinary field that addresses the structure, processing, and property relationships in materials for engineering applications. Basic principles of chemistry and physics are applied to provide an understanding of the structure of materials and the manner in which the structure determines the properties. Scientific processing methods are then applied to yield the necessary properties, which then can be integrated with, and designed to accommodate the needs of, modern technology.
							

								Advances in materials enable technological progress in many fields. Historically, this connection between materials and technology has been so intimate that major periods in civilization have been named after the dominant material used in that era (e.g., Bronze Age, Iron Age). In the past few decades, at the core of the progress in such diverse fields as transportation, communication, electronics, energy and environment are significant advances in materials. Materials science and engineering is a broad and growing discipline.
							

								Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Washington has recently experienced rapid expansion into new research areas, including polymers, hybrids, biomaterials, biomimetics, nanomaterials, photonic and magnetic materials. These areas have applications in current and emerging industries, and complement existing strength in ceramics, metals, electronic materials, and composites.

				Science for Teachers Program Overview
			

				The Master of Science in Science for Teachers (MSST) is a graduate degree in science developed specifically for teachers and administered by the College of the Environment. Because science is moving at ever-increasing speeds, with new breakthroughs, innovations and technologies, keeping pace requires science educators to engage in hands-on, high-level, real-life science. The MSST program has three core components: practicing science through an independently-designed research project, deepened disciplinary content knowledge, and the development of an interdisciplinary skill set. These components work together to give teachers the opportunity to experience directly how the three dimensions of the Next Generation Science Standards (cross-cutting concepts, science and engineering practices, core disciplinary ideas) are integrated and realized in cutting-edge contemporary science.

School Overview

						116 Fishery Sciences
					

						The School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS) encompasses multi-disciplinary programs at the interface between the traditional fields of natural history, environmental biology, and natural resource management. Primary foci are the management of sustainable fisheries of commercially important species; biocomplexity and ecosystem-based management; and sustainable aquaculture. In addition, human-induced effects on natural ecosystems (including habitat change and restoration, impacts of climate change, emerging diseases, the effects of invasive species, and processes affecting endangered species and declining populations) are major areas of research. In pursuit of these objectives, a variety of basic sciences are used, including ecology and evolution, population biology, behavior, physiology, microbiology, and genetics. The scope of aquatic systems ranges from watersheds, rivers and lakes, to estuarine and near-shore shelf, open ocean systems and culture facilities. Graduates of the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences are uniquely qualified for careers in universities as well as other educational settings, natural resources management agencies at the local to international levels, environmental consulting, and non-profit organizations with an environmental focus.

						(206) 543-7457
safsadv@uw.edu


						The School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS) offers the following programs of study:
					


							The Bachelor of Science, with a major in aquatic and fishery sciences
						

							A minor in aquatic and fishery sciences
						

							An interdisciplinary minor in marine biology
						

							An interdisciplinary minor in quantitative science
						


						The school's undergraduate program has been substantially modified in recent years to reflect student and faculty interests in ecology and conservation biology, as well as more traditional fields such as stock assessment and fishery management. Faculty dedication to teaching, substantial benefit gained in close faculty contact within a relatively small program, and significant experiential training and research have made SAFS an appealing major that has doubled in recent years. The bachelor of science degree provides an underpinning in sciences such as biology, chemistry, and mathematics/statistics, then adds a core curriculum within aquatic sciences. Students study within areas of individual interest, grouped in three primary areas: aquatic ecology, conservation and management of aquatic resources, and biology and culture of aquatic animals.

						Rapid growth of research in atmospheric sciences began in the late 1940s in response to needs and opportunities in weather forecasting. Extensive research is now underway to extend the time scale over which useful forecasts can be made and to increase the amount of regional and temporal detail in short-range forecasts. In addition, the atmospheric sciences now address a broad range of other problems of fundamental interest and importance. Examples include changes in climate that could result from increases in atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases, and the application of remote-sensing techniques to the monitoring and understanding of weather and climate.
					

						Graduate students in the atmospheric sciences come from a variety of disciplines: physics, chemistry, engineering, atmospheric or geophysical sciences, and applied mathematics. Each of these backgrounds is valuable for specific subfields within the atmospheric sciences. However, students should have in common a sound background in the fundamentals of physics and applied mathematics and an interest in complex natural phenomena. The well-prepared graduate student may expect to begin research work rather quickly.
