The University of Washington (commonly referred to as UW, simply Washington, or informally U-Dub) is a public research university in Seattle, Washington.
Founded in 1861, Washington was first established in downtown Seattle approximately a decade after the city's founding to aid its economic development.
Today, the university's 703-acre main Seattle campus is situated in the University District above the Montlake Cut, within the urban Puget Sound region of the Pacific Northwest.
The university has two additional campuses in Tacoma and Bothell.
Overall, UW encompasses over 500 buildings and over 20 million gross square footage of space, including one of the largest library systems in the world with over 26 university libraries, as well as the UW Tower, lecture halls, art centers, museums, laboratories, stadiums, and conference centers.
The university offers bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees through 140 departments in various colleges and schools, sees about 46,000 in total student enrollment every year, and functions on a quarter system.
Washington is a member of the Association of American Universities and classified as an R1 Doctoral Research University classification under the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.
It is cited as a leading university in the world for scientific performance and research output by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and the CWTS Leiden Ranking.
In the 2015 fiscal year, the UW received nearly $1.2 billion in research funding, the 3rd largest among all universities in the United States.
The University has been affiliated with many notable alumni and faculty, including 20 Nobel Prize laureates and numerous Pulitzer Prize winners, Fulbright Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, as well as members of other distinguished institutions.
The original University building, c. 1870.
In 1854, territorial governor Isaac Stevens recommended the establishment of a university in the Washington Territory.
Prominent Seattle-area residents, including Methodist preacher Daniel Bagley, saw this as a chance to add to the city's potential and prestige.
Bagley learned of a law that allowed United States territories to sell land to raise money in support of public schools.
At the time, Arthur A. Denny, an early founder of Seattle and member of the territorial legislature, aimed to increase the city's importance by moving the territory's capital from Olympia to Seattle.
However, Bagley eventually convinced Denny that the establishment of a university would assist more in the development of Seattle's economy.
Two universities were initially chartered, but later the decision was repealed in favor of a single university in Lewis County provided that locally donated land was available.
When no site emerged, Denny successfully petitioned the legislature to reconsider Seattle as a location in 1858.
In 1861, scouting began for an appropriate 10 acres (4 ha) site in Seattle to serve as a new university campus.
Arthur and Mary Denny donated eight acres, while fellow pioneers Edward Lander, and Charlie and Mary Terry, donated two acres on Denny's Knoll in downtown Seattle.
More specifically, this tract was bounded by 4th Avenue to the west, 6th Avenue to the east, Union Street to the north, and Seneca Streets to the south.
John Pike, for whom Pike Street is named was the architect and builder.
On November 4, 1861, the university opened as the Territorial University of Washington.
The legislature passed articles incorporating the University, and establishing its Board of Regents in 1862.
The school initially struggled, closing three times: in 1863 for low enrollment and again in 1867 and 1876 due to funds shortage.
Washington successfully awarded its first graduate Clara Antoinette McCarty Wilt in 1876, with a bachelor's degree in science.
By the time Washington State entered the Union in 1889, both Seattle and the University had grown substantially.
Washington's total undergraduate enrollment increased from 30 to nearly 300 students, and the campus's relative isolation in downtown Seattle faced encroaching development.
A special legislative committee, headed by UW graduate Edmond Meany, was created to find a new campus to better serve the growing student population and faculty.
The committee eventually selected a site on the northeast of downtown Seattle called Union Bay, which was the land of the Duwamish, and the legislature appropriated funds for its purchase and construction.
In 1895, the University relocated to the new campus by moving into the newly built Denny Hall.
The University Regents tried and failed to sell the old campus, eventually settling with leasing the area.
This would later become one of the University's most valuable pieces of real estate in modern-day Seattle, generating millions in annual revenue with what is now called the Metropolitan Tract.
The original Territorial University building was torn down in 1908, and its former site now houses the Fairmont Olympic Hotel.
The sole-surviving remnants of Washington's first building are four 24-foot (7.3 m), white, hand-fluted cedar, Ionic columns.
They were salvaged by Edmond S. Meany, one of the University's first graduates and former head of its history department.
Meany and his colleague, Dean Herbert T. Condon, dubbed the columns as "Loyalty," "Industry," "Faith", and "Efficiency", or "LIFE."
The columns now stand in the Sylvan Grove Theater.
Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition on the UW campus toward Mount Rainier in 1909
Organizers of the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition eyed the still largely undeveloped campus as a prime setting for their world's fair.
They came to an agreement with Washington's Board of Regents that allowed them to use the campus grounds for the exposition, surrounding today's Drumheller Fountain facing towards Mount Rainier.
In exchange, organizers agreed Washington would take over the campus and its development after the fair's conclusion.
This arrangement led to a detailed site plan and several new buildings, prepared in part by John Charles Olmsted.
The plan was later incorporated into the overall UW campus master plan, permanently affecting the campus layout.

Both World Wars brought the military to campus, with certain facilities temporarily lent to the federal government.
Regardless, subsequent post-war periods were times of dramatic growth for the University.
The period between the wars saw a significant expansion on the upper campus.
Construction of the Liberal Arts Quadrangle, known to students as "The Quad," began in 1916 and continued to 1939.
The University's architectural centerpiece, Suzzallo Library, was built in 1926 and expanded in 1935.
After World War II, further growth came with the G.I.
Among the most important developments of this period was the opening of the School of Medicine in 1946, now consistently ranked as the top medical school in the United States.
It would eventually also led to the University of Washington Medical Center, ranked by U.S. News and World Report to be among the top ten hospitals in the nation.

During this era, many Japanese Americans were sent away to internment camps along the west coast, as part of Executive Order 9066 following the attacks on Pearl Harbor.
Many Japanese American students and "soon-to-be" graduates were unable to receive diplomas, or be recognized for accomplishments at the University, until Washington's commemoration ceremony for the Japanese Americans entitled The Long Journey Home, in May 2008.
From 1958-1973, the University of Washington saw tremendous growth in students, faculties, operating budget, and prestige under leadership of Charles Odegaard.
UW student enrollment had more than doubled to 34,000 as the baby boom generation came of age.
However, this era was also marked by high levels of student activism, as was the case at many American universities.
Much of the unrest focused around civil rights and opposition to the Vietnam War.
Odegaard instituted a vision of building a "community of scholars", convincing the Washington State legislatures to increase their investments towards the University.
Washington senators, such as Henry M. Jackson and Warren G. Magnuson, also used their political clout to build research funds for UW.
The results included an operating budget increase of $37 million in 1958 to over $400 million in 1973, and solidified UW as a top recipients of federal research funds in the United States even today.
Establishment of technology giants such as Microsoft, Boeing and Amazon near UW has also proved to be highly influential, not only improving graduate prospects,

In 1990, the University of Washington opened additional campuses in Bothell and Tacoma.
Although originally intended for students who have already completed two years of higher education, both schools have transitioned into four-year, degree-granting universities.
The first freshman class for these campuses came in the fall of 2006, and both campuses now offer a selection of master's degree programs as well.
In 2012, the University began exploring plans and governmental approval to expand the main Seattle campus, which includes significant increases in student housing, teaching facilities for the growing student body and faculty, as well as expanded public transit options.
The UW station, completed in March 2015, It represents a previously unavailable option of transportation into and out of the campus, designed specifically to reduce dependence on private vehicles, bicycles and local King County buses.
The Quad, a core fixture of the campus, is lined with Yoshino cherry trees.

UW's main campus is situated in Seattle, by the shores of Union and Portage Bays with views of the Cascade Range to the east, and the Olympic Mountains to the west.
The site encompasses 703 acres (2.84 km2) bounded by N.E.
45th Street on the north, N.E.
Pacific Street on the south, Montlake Boulevard N.E.
on the east, and 15th Avenue N.E.
Red Square is the heart of the campus, surrounded by landmark buildings such as Suzzallo Library, the Broken Obelisk, and the statue of George Washington.
It functions as the central hub for students, and hosts a variety of events annually.
University Way, known locally as "The Ave", lies nearby and is a focus for much student life at the university.

North Campus features some of UW's most recognized landscapes as well as landmarks, stretching from the signature University of Washington Quad directly north of Red Square to N.E.
South Campus occupies the land between Pacific Street and the Lake Washington Ship Canal.
The land was previously the site of the University Golf Course but was given up to construct a building for the School of Medicine.
Today, South Campus is the location of UW's health sciences and natural sciences facilities, including the UW Medical Center and the Magnuson Health Sciences Center as well as locations for instruction and research in oceanography, bioengineering, biology, genome sciences, hydraulics, and comparative medicine.
The East Campus area stretches east of Montlake Boulevard to Laurelhurst and is largely taken up by wetlands and Huskies sports facilities and recreation fields, including Husky Stadium, Hec Edmundson Pavilion, and Husky Ballpark.
While the area directly north of the sports facilities is home to UW's computer science and engineering programs, which includes computer labs once used by Paul G. Allen and Bill Gates for their prior venture before establishing Microsoft, the area northeast of the sports facilities is occupied by components of the UW Botanic Gardens, such as the Union Bay Natural Area, the UW Farm, and the Center for Urban Horticulture.
Further east is the Ceramic and Metal Arts Building and Laurel Village, which provides family housing for registered full-time students.
East Campus is also the location of the UW light rail station.
West Campus consists of mainly modernist structures located on city streets, and stretches between 15th Avenue and Interstate 5 from the Ship Canal, to N.E.
It is home to the College of Built Environments, School of Social Work, Fishery Sciences Building, UW Police Department as well as many of the University's residence halls and apartments, such as Stevens Court, Mercer Court, Alder Hall and Elm Hall.

In 2017 the University reported $4.893 billion in revenues and $5.666 billion in expenses, resulting in an operating loss of $774 million.
This loss was offset by $342 million in state appropriations, $443 million in investment income, $166 million in gifts, and $185 million of other non-operating revenues.
Endowed gifts are commingled in the University's Consolidated Endowment Fund, managed by an internal investment company at an annual cost of approximately $6.2 million.
Major recent spending includes $131 million on the UW Animal Research and Care Facility, $72 million on the Nano-engineering and Sciences Building, $61 million building on the Workday HR & Payroll System, $50 million on the Denny Hall Renovation, $44 million on the West Campus Utility Plant, $26 million on the UW Medical Center Expansion Phase 2, $25 million on the UW Tacoma Urban Solutions Center, and $21 million on the UW Police Department.
Environmental sustainability has long been a major focus of the University's Board of Regents and Presidents.
In February 2006, the UW joined a partnership with Seattle City Light as part of their Green Up Program, ensuring that all of Seattle campus' electricity is supplied by and purchased from renewable sources.
Additionally, UW's Student Housing and Food Services (HFS) office has dedicated several million dollars annually towards locally produced, organic, and natural foods.
HFS also seized the use of foam food containers on-campus, and instead opted for compostable cups, plates, utensils, and packaging whenever possible.
New residence halls planned for 2020 are also expected to meet silver or gold LEED standards.

The rebuilt Husky Stadium, in 2016.
The rebuilt Husky Stadium is the first and primary source of income for the completely remodeled athletic district.
The major remodel consisted of a new grand concourse, underground light-rail station which opened on March 19, 2016, an enclosed west end design, replacement of bleachers with individual seating, removal of track and Huskytron, as well as the installation of a new press box section, private box seating, football offices, permanent seating in the east end zone that does not block the view of Lake Washington.
The project also included new and improved amenities, concession stands, and bathrooms throughout.
The cost for renovating the stadium was around $280 million, and was designed for a slightly lower seating capacity than its previous design, now at 70,138 seats.
Besides hosting national and regional football games, the Husky Stadium is also used by the University for its annual Commencement event, departmental ceremonies, and other events.
Husky Stadium is one of several places that may have been the birthplace of the crowd phenomenon known as "The Wave".
It is claimed that the wave was invented by Husky graduate Robb Weller and UW band director Bill Bissel in October 1981, for an afternoon game facing opponents from Stanford University.
The University of Washington's costumed mascot is Harry the Husky.
"Harry the Husky" performs at sporting and special events, and a live Alaskan Malamute, currently named Dubs, has traditionally led the UW football team onto the field at the start of games.
The school colors of purple and gold were adopted in 1892 by student vote.
The choice was inspired by the first stanza of Lord Byron's The Destruction of Sennacherib:
The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.

Additionally, the University has also hosted a long line of Alaskan Malamutes as mascots.
The dogs were originally cared for by the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity; This arrangement was followed by a 49-year tradition (1959–2008) of care by the Cross family (a UW professor, followed by his son).
The 13 dogs thus far are as follows:
The University of Washington Husky Marching Band performs at many Husky sporting events including all football games.
The band was founded in 1929, and today it is a cornerstone of Husky spirit.
The band marches using a traditional high step, and it is one of only a few marching bands left in the United States to do so.
Like many college bands, the Husky band has several traditional songs that it has played for decades, including the official fight songs "Bow Down to Washington" and "Tequila", as well as fan-favorite "Africano".

Our recent Ph.D. graduates have received offers from essentially every top academic program and industrial research laboratory, and dozens of our recent graduates populate these strong programs.
In addition, we offer a Professional Masters Program that is designed for fully-employed professionals in the region's information technology industry.
This program features a mix of distance learning and evening courses.
It enrolls roughly 150 students from more than two dozen leading companies in the greater Seattle area, and grants an additional 45 Masters degrees per year.
UW also offers an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in Computational Molecular Biology involving several departments in the biological and mathematical sciences, including Computer Science & Engineering.
CSE offers two Bachelors degrees: a Computer Science degree offered through the College of Arts & Sciences, and a Computer Engineering degree offered through the College of Engineering and accredited by ABET.
Together, these programs are growing to award 450+ degrees annually.
We additionally participate in the Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences program with our colleagues from Applied Mathematics, Mathematics, and Statistics.
There is also an optional Data Science Specialization for those students majoring in Computer Science who are interested in developing a foundation in one of the fastest-growing areas of the field.
Our introductory course sequence, CSE 142 / CSE 143, enrolls more than 3,500 students annually from across the campus.
Because the demand for our undergraduate major programs exceeds the capacity, students are admitted on a competitive basis.
Our undergraduates are wonderfully strong, classes are small, and interaction with the faculty is high.
Undergraduate participation in research is common.
Intensive capstone design courses are a hallmark of our undergraduate major programs; several recent offerings are highlighted in these videos.
The Allen School is among the top suppliers of students in the nation to leading high-tech firms such as Microsoft, Amazon.com, and Google.
In addition, we are the leading supplier to many regional companies.
Because Washington State has a vibrant computing industry, roughly 90% of our graduates remain in-state.
In the course of their education, the vast majority of our undergraduates participate in co-ops or internships, which we feel enhance the effectiveness of an undergraduate engineering education.
Allen School students have received the Rhodes Scholarship, Goldwater Scholarship, Marshall Scholarship, Gates Cambridge Scholarship, and Google Anita Borg Scholarship.
Within the University of Washington, our students have dominated the University Medals and Dean's Medals.
Since 2000, fully one-third of the annual high scholarship medals awarded by the University have gone to CSE majors - our "fair share" is 2%.
In the past decade, 10 winners of the annual Dean's Medals awarded to the top graduates in Arts & Science and in Engineering have gone to CSE majors.
In the past decade, 33 of our students have been recognized in the Computing Research Association's Undergraduate Research Award competition - the most of any program in the nation.
The Puget Sound region is increasingly prominent as a national and international technology center.
Key strengths of the University of Washington include medicine, biotechnology, the physical sciences, the marine and environmental sciences, and computing and allied areas of science and engineering.
Pike Place Market and Elliot Bay
Adjacent to the University of Washington are a number of major R&D facilities with which we have close ties, such as Microsoft Research, Google Seattle and Google Kirkland, Amazon.com, Adobe Advanced Technology Labs, Lee Hood's Institute for Systems Biology, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
Strong collaborations exist among these groups, with the Allen School playing a major role in the University and the region.
Our annual Affiliates Meeting is a forum for interaction among 75 leadership companies from the region and the nation.
Our professional Masters degree program and our colloquium series (broadcast on UWTV and live on the Internet) play significant roles in keeping the region's leading-edge workforce current.
Working with UW Educational Outreach, we offer more than a dozen "Extension Certificate Programs" that generated roughly 5,000 course enrollments during the most recent year.
We are actively involved with regional leadership organizations such as the Washington Technology Industry Association and the Technology Alliance.
Seattle, consistently acclaimed as one of the most livable cities in the nation, is a terrific place to be.
Seattle is a cosmopolitan city situated in the midst of the beauty and diversity of the Pacific Northwest.
The University of Washington is located on Lake Washington, a few miles east of Puget Sound.
The Cascade Mountains are one hour to the east; the Olympic Peninsula and Olympic Mountains are two hours to the west.
The Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering
Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science and Engineering
In Autumn 2003, UW CSE moved to the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering.
The Allen Center is a true public/private partnership, funded by the State of Washington, the University of Washington, and more than 250 friends and alumni.
The six-story (plus basement) building increases CSE's total space by a factor of 2.5, and our laboratory space by a factor of 3; it affords sweeping views of Lake Washington, the Cascade Mountains, Mount Rainier, and the Space Needle.
