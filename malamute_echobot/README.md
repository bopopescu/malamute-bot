# EE596 Lab 1 -- Building an Alexa Skill using Alicebot

Course Webpage: [EE596 Spring 2019-- Conversational Artificial Intelligence](https://hao-cheng.github.io/ee596_spr2019/)


## Task 1: Set up an local DynamoDB sever 
- Follow the instruction [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning.html) to set up a local DynamoDB server.
DynamoBD is a basically a scalable database which can be used for storing either conversation history or content.
For Lab 1, only the conversation history is stored in DynamoDB.


## Task 2: Set up an Echobot server
### Requirements
* Python >= 3.6
* virtualenv

### Steps
* Create a virtual environment and install required libraries.
```
$ virtualenv virtenv --python=python3
$ source virtenv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Launch the Echobot server.
First, adds two files `~/.aws/config`
```
[default]
region=us-west-2
```
and `~/.aws/credentials`
```
[default]
aws_secret_access_key = fakeSecretAccessKey
aws_access_key_id = fakeMyKeyId

```

```
$ source virtenv/bin/activate
$ cd src
$ python echobot_server.py
```


* Talk to the Echobot through the console. Enter "stop" to end the conversation.
```
$ source virtenv/bin/activate
$ cd clients
$ python console_client.py --logdir $LOGDIR
```

## Task 3: Replace the Echobot with an Alicebot.
In this task, you need to use Alicebot for generating bot responses.
You can directly edit the file `src/bots/echobot/bot.py`. 
Alternative, you can create a new folder `src/bots/alicebot` for the Alicebot and create a new `src/alicebot_server.py` file to
launch the server.

Please install [Python-AIML](https://github.com/paulovn/python-aiml) and read the documents for creating an Aliebot.
Specifically, make sure you take a look at
```python-aiml/aiml/script/bot.py```
and see whether you can talk with Alicebot interatively use that file.

For this lab, please bootstrap the AIML kernel using a brain file.

Here are a few rounds of interactions with the Alicebot through the console.
If you want, you can also replace the `Bot Reprompt`.
```
======== Round Index: 1 ========
Bot Utterance:  Hi there!
Bot Reprompt:  TBD
User Utterance: how are you
======== Round Index: 2 ========
Bot Utterance:  My logic and cognitive functions are normal.
Bot Reprompt:  TBD
User Utterance: what's your name
======== Round Index: 3 ========
Bot Utterance:  My name is Nameless.
Bot Reprompt:  TBD
User Utterance: do you like to chat
======== Round Index: 4 ========
Bot Utterance:  Talking is my primary function.
Bot Reprompt:  TBD
User Utterance: 
```

## Task 4: Create an Alexa Skill
In this task, you will create an Alexa Skill that uses the Alicebot server on your laptop as the endpoint.
In this way, you enable voice-based interactions for the Alicebot.

### Requirements
* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
* [Amazon Skill Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit)

### Steps
- Register an account for [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) and install ngrok on your laptop.
- Expose your local server (port 8080) to the internet using ngrok
```
$ ngrok http 8080
```
- Create an Amazon developer account [here](https://developer.amazon.com/) and follow the [walkthrough](https://hao-cheng.github.io/ee596_spr2019/slides/lab_1-walkthrough.pdf).

## Lab Checkoff
* Chat with the Alicebot using both the Console and the Echo dot.

## Lab Report
* Upload your codes in `src/` as a zip file.
* Paste some sample dialogues you had with the Alicebot.
* Discuss the strength and weakness of the Alicebot.
